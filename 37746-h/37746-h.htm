<h3>THE MINING CAMP</h3>

<p class="cap">I<span class="smcap">t</span> was an October day in Gila,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Arizona. The one
street of the mining camp wound around the foothills,
and led eastward to Line Canyon, which, at
that point, divides Arizona from New Mexico.
Four saloons, an opium den, a store of general
merchandise,&mdash;owned and operated by the mining company,&mdash;a
repair shop, one large, pretentious adobe
house,&mdash;the headquarters of the company, where superintendent,
assayers, and mining engineers boarded,&mdash;several
small dwelling houses, and many miners' shacks,
constituted the town.</p>

<p>A little further to the eastward, around a bend in
the foothills, and near Line Canyon, lay Clayton Ranch,&mdash;the
most historic, as well as the most picturesque spot
in that region. Near the dwelling house, but closer to
the river than the Clayton home, stood a little adobe
schoolhouse.</p>

<p>The town, facing south, overlooked Gila River and
its wooded banks. Beyond the Gila, as in every direction,
stretched foothills and mountains. Toward the
south towered Mt. Graham, the highest peak of the
Pinaleno range, blue in the distance, and crowned with
snow.</p>

<p>Up a pathway of the foothills, west of the town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
bounding forward as if such a climb were but joy to
her, came a slight, girlish figure. She paused now and
then to turn her face westward, watching the changing
colors of sunset.</p>

<p>At last she reached a bowlder, and, seating herself,
leaned against it, removed her sombrero hat, pushed back
the moist curls from her forehead, and turned again to
the sunset. The sun, for one supreme moment, poised on
a mountain peak, then slowly sank, flashing its message
of splendor into the majestic dome of the sky, over
snow-capped mountains, over gigantic cliffs of red sandstone,
over stretches of yellow foothills, and then caught
the white-robed figure, leaning against the bowlder, in
its rosy glow. The girl lifted her fine, sensitive face.
Again she pushed the curls from her forehead. As she
lifted her arm, her sleeve slipped back, revealing an
arm and hand of exquisite form, and patrician to the
tips of the fingers.</p>

<p>She seemed absorbed in the scene before her, unconscious
that she was the loveliest part of it. But
if she was unconscious of the fact, a horseman who
drew rein a short distance away, and who watched her
intently a few moments, was not. At last the girl
stirred, as though to continue on her way. Instantly
the horseman gave his horse a sharp cut with his whip,
and went cantering up the ascent before her.</p>

<p>The sudden sound of a horse's hoofs startled her,
and she glanced up to see the horseman and his thoroughbred
speeding toward the town.</p>

<p>She swung her sombrero hat over her shoulder, and
gathered up her flowers; then, with a lingering glance
to westward, turned and walked rapidly toward Gila.</p>

<p>By the time she had reached the one long street, many
cowboys and miners had already congregated about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
saloons. She dreaded to pass there at this hour, but
this she must do in order to reach Clayton Ranch,
nearly a mile beyond.</p>

<p>As she drew near one saloon, she heard uproarious
laughter. The voices were loud and boisterous. It was
impossible for her to escape hearing what was said. It
was evident to her that she herself was at that moment
the topic of conversation.</p>

<p>"She'll git all the Bible school she wants Sunday
afternoon, or my name's not Pete Tompkins," ejaculated
a bar-tender as he stepped to the bar of a saloon.</p>

<p>"What're ye goin' ter do, Pete?" asked a young
miner. "I'm in f'r y'r game, or my name ain't Bill
Hines."</p>

<p>"I?" answered the individual designated as Pete
Tompkins, "I mean ter give 'er a reception, Bill, a
<i>reception</i>." Here he laughed boisterously. "I repeat
it," he said. "I'll give 'er a reception, an' conterive
ter let 'er understan' that no sech infernal business as
a Bible school 'll be tol'ated in these yere parts o'
Arizony. Them as wants ter join me in smashin' this
cussed Sunday business step ter the bar. I'll treat the
hull blanked lot o' ye."</p>

<p>The girl passing along the street shuddered. The
brutal voice went on:</p>

<p>"Set up the glasses o' whiskey, Keith. Here, Jess an'
Kate. We want yer ter have a hand in smashin' this
devilish Bible school. Another glass fur Jess, Keith, an'
one fur Kate."</p>

<p>The pedestrian quickened her pace, but still the voice
followed her.</p>

<p>"Here's ter y'r healths, an' ter the smashin' o' the
Bible school, an' ter the reception we'll give the new
schoolma'am."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>The stranger heard the clink of glasses, mingled
with the uproar of laughter. Then she caught the
words:</p>

<p>"Ye don't jine us, Hastings. P'r'aps y're too 'ristercratic,
or p'r'aps y're gone on the gal! Ha-ha-ha-ha!"</p>

<p>The saloon rang with the laughter of the men and
women.</p>

<p>The girl who had just passed quickened her pace,
her cheeks tingling with indignation. As she hastened
on, the man addressed as Hastings replied haughtily:</p>

<p>"I am a <i>man</i>, and being a man I cannot see insult
offered to any woman, especially when that woman is
making an effort to do some good in this Godless
region."</p>

<p>"He's gone on 'er, sure, Bill. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Imagine
me, Pete Tompkins, gone on the schoolma'am!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!"</p>

<p>His companions joined in his laughter.</p>

<p>"What'ud she think o' my figger, Bill?" he asked,
as he strutted across the saloon. "How 'ud I look by
'er side in Virginny reel, eh? I'm afeared it 'ud be
the devil an' angel in comp'ny. Ha-ha-ha!"</p>

<p>"Y're right thar," replied one of the men. "Ye
certain are a devil, an' she do look like a angel."</p>

<p>"Say, fellers," said Bill Hines, "me an' Pete an' all
o' ye ought ter git some slime from the river, an' throw
on them white dresses o' hern. I don't like nobody
settin' theirselves up to be better'n we be, even in
clo'es, do ye, Jess?"</p>

<p>Jess agreed with him.</p>

<p>"What's all this noise about?" interrupted a new
comer.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mark Clifton, is that you? Well, me an'
Bill an' Jess an' the other kids is plannin' ter smash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
schoolma'am's Bible school, Sunday. We're goin' ter
give 'er a reception."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" asked Clifton.</p>

<p>"Ye kin jine the party an' we'll show yer."</p>

<p>"Let me urge you to leave Miss Bright alone. She
has not harmed you. Leave the Bible school alone,
too, and attend to your own business."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's a saint, ain't he! He is!" sneered Pete
Tompkins. "What about this gal as he has with him
here? More whiskey! Fill up the glasses, Keith.
Come, Jess. Come, Kate Harraday." And the half-intoxicated
man swung one woman around and tried to
dance a jig, failing in which, he fell to the floor puffing
and swearing.</p>

<p>Mark Clifton's face darkened. He grasped a chair
and stepped forward, as if to strike the speaker. He
hesitated. As he did so, a handsome cowboy entered,
followed by a little Indian boy of perhaps six years of
age.</p>

<p>"What's the row, Hastings?" asked the cowboy in a
low voice.</p>

<p>"Pete Tompkins and Bill Hines and their ilk are
planning to give Miss Bright, the new teacher, some
trouble when she attempts to start a Bible school to-morrow
afternoon. Clifton remonstrated, and they
taunted him about Carla Earle. That enraged him."</p>

<p>"What do they plan ter do?"</p>

<p>"I fancy they'll do every blackguard thing they can
think of. They are drunk now, but when they are
sober they may reconsider. At any rate, the decent
men of the camp ought to be on the spot to protect that
girl, Harding."</p>

<p>"I'll be there fur one, Hastings. Have yer seen
'er?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. As I rode into camp just now I passed someone
I took to be Miss Bright."</p>

<p>"Pretty as a picter, ain't she?" said Jack Harding.</p>

<p>"Look, there she goes around the bend of the road
towards Claytons'. There goes y'r teacher, Wathemah."</p>

<p>The Indian child bounded to the door.</p>

<p>"Me teacher, <i>me</i> teacher," he said over and over
to himself, as he watched the receding figure.</p>

<p>"<i>Your</i> teacher, eh, sonny," said Kenneth Hastings
smiling. He laid his hand on the child's head.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>me</i> teacher," said the boy proudly.</p>

<p>His remark was overheard by Pete Tompkins.</p>

<p>"Lookee here, boys! There goes Wathemah's teacher.
Now's y'r chance, my hearties. See the nat'ral cur'osity
as is to start a religion shop, an' grind us fellers
inter angels. Are my wings sproutin'?"</p>

<p>As he spoke the words, he flapped his elbows up and
down. Kenneth Hastings and Jack Harding exchanged
glances. Mark Clifton had gone.</p>

<p>Pete Tompkins hereupon stepped to the door and
called out:</p>

<p>"Three cheers fur the angel o' the Gila, my hearties.
One, two, three! Now! That's it. Now! Death to
the Bible school!"</p>

<p>"Death to the Bible school!" shouted they in unison.</p>

<p>The little Indian heard their words. He knew that
insult and, possibly, injury threatened his teacher, and,
stepping up to Pete Tompkins, he kicked his shins with
all his childish strength, uttering oaths that drew forth
hilarious laughter from the men.</p>

<p>"Y're a good un," said one.</p>

<p>"Give 'im a trounce in the air," added another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
In a moment, the child was tossed from one to another,
his passionate cries and curses mingling with
their ribald laughter. At last he was caught by John
Harding, who held him in his arms.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Wathemah," he said soothingly.</p>

<p>Hoarse with rage, the child shrieked, "You blankety
blanked devils! You blankety blanked devils!"</p>

<p>A ruffian cursed him.</p>

<p>He was wild. He struggled to free himself, to return
to the fray, but Jack Harding held him fast.</p>

<p>"You devils, devils, devils!" he shrieked again. His
little frame trembled with anger, and he burst into
tears.</p>

<p>"Never mind, little chap," said his captor, drawing
him closer, "ye go with me."</p>

<p>For once John Harding left the saloon without touching
liquor. The Indian child was clasped in his arms.
When he reached a place beyond the sound of the men's
voices, he set the little lad on his feet. He patted him
on the head, and looked down compassionately into the
tear-stained face.</p>

<p>"Poor little chap," he said, "poor little chap. Y're
like me, ain't ye? Ye ain't got nobody in the world.
Let's be pards, Wathemah!"</p>

<p>"Pards?" repeated the child between sobs.</p>

<p>"Yes, pards, sonny. That's what I said."</p>

<p>Wathemah clasped his arms about Jack's knees.</p>

<p>"Me <i>teacher</i> pard too?" he asked, trying bravely to
stop crying.</p>

<p>"Yourn, not mine, sonny," answered Harding, smiling.
Then hand in hand, they strolled toward Clayton
Ranch. And this was the strengthening of the comradeship
between the two, which was as loyal as it was
tender.</p>

<p>Kenneth Hastings overtook them, then passed them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
He reached Clayton Ranch, hesitated a moment, then
walked rapidly toward Line Canyon.</p>

<p>For some indefinable reason he did not call that
evening at Clayton Ranch as was his custom, nor did
he knock at that door for many days. On the following
Monday, he was called to a distant mining camp,
where he was detained by business. So it happened
that he was one of the last to meet the new teacher
whose coming was to mean so much to his life and to
the people of Gila.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE DAWN OF A NEW DAY</h3>

<p class="cap">F<span class="smcap">or</span> many days, public attention had been centered
upon Esther Bright, the new teacher
in Gila. Her grasp of the conditions of the
school, her power to cope with the lawless
element there, and her absolute mastery of
the situation had now become matters of local history.
Her advent in Gila had been a nine days' wonder to the
Gilaites; now, her presence there had come to be regarded
as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Every new feature introduced into the school life,
every new acquaintance made, deepened her hold upon
the better life of the community. Moreover, her vital
interest in the people awakened in them a responsive
interest in her.</p>

<p>Fearlessly she tramped the foothills and canyons,
returning laden with flowers and geological specimens.
Learning her interest in these things, many people of
the camp began to contribute to her collections.</p>

<p>Here in the Rockies, Nature pours out her treasures
with lavish hand. White men had long dwelt in the
midst of her marvelous wealth of scenic beauty, amazingly
ignorant of any values there save that which had
a purchasing power and could be counted in dollars
and cents.</p>

<p>The mountains were ministering to the soul life of
Esther Bright. The strength of the hills became hers.
Nature's pages of history lay open before her; but more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
interesting to her than cell or crystal, or tree or flower,
or the shining company of the stars, were the human
beings she found fettered by ignorance and sin. The
human element made demands upon her mind and heart.
Here was something for her to do. If they had been a
colony of blind folk or cripples, their condition could
not have appealed more strongly to her sympathy.
Profanity, gambling, drunkenness and immorality were
about her everywhere. The vices of the adults had
long been imitated as play by the children. So one
of Esther Bright's first innovations in school work was
to organize play and teach games, and be in the midst
of children at play. She was philosopher enough to
realize that evil habits of years could not be uprooted
at once; but she did such heroic weeding that the playground
soon became comparatively decent. How to
save the children, and how to help the older people of
the community were absorbing questions to her. She
was a resourceful woman, and began at once to plan
wisely, and methodically carried out her plans. In her
conferences with Mr. Clayton, her school trustee, she
repeatedly expressed her conviction that the greatest
work before them was to bring this great human need
into vital relation with God. So it came about very
naturally that a movement to organize a Bible school
began in Gila.</p>

<p>Into every home, far and near, went Esther Bright,
always sympathetic, earnest and enthusiastic. Her enthusiasm
proved contagious. There had been days of
this house to house visitation, and now the day of the
organization of the Bible school was at hand.</p>

<p>In the morning, Esther went to the schoolhouse to
see that all was in readiness. She paused, as she so
often did, to wonder at the glory of the scene. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
schoolhouse itself was a part of the picture. It was
built of huge blocks of reddish brown adobe, crumbled
at the corners. The red tile roof added a picturesque
bit of color to the landscape. Just above the roof, at
the right, rose an ample chimney. At the left, and a
little back of the schoolhouse, towered two giant cactuses.
To the north, stretched great barren foothills,
like vast sand dunes by the sea, the dreariness of their
gray-white, or reddish soil relieved only by occasional
bunches of gray-green sage, mesquite bushes, cacti and
the Spanish dagger, with its sword-like foliage, and tall
spikes of seed-pods.</p>

<p>Beyond the foothills, miles away, though seeming
near, towered rugged, cathedral-like masses of snow-capped
mountains. The shadows flitted over the earth,
now darkening the mountain country, now leaving floods
of light.</p>

<p>All along the valley of the Gila River, stretched great
fields of green alfalfa. Here and there, above the
green, towered feathery pampas plumes.</p>

<p>The river, near the schoolhouse, made a bend northward.
Along its banks were cottonwood trees, aspen,
and sycamore, covered with green mistletoe, and tangles
of vines. No wonder Esther paused to drink in the
beauty. It was a veritable garden of the gods.</p>

<p>At last she entered the schoolhouse. She carried
with her Bibles, hymn books, and lesson leaves, all contributions
from her grandfather. Already, the room was
decorated with mountain asters of brilliant colors. She
looked around with apparent satisfaction, for the room
had been made beautiful with the flowers. She passed
out, locked the door, and returned to the Clayton home.</p>

<p>In the saloons, all that morning, the subject of gossip
had been the Bible school. John Harding and Kenneth Hastings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
occasionally sauntering in, gathered that serious
trouble was brewing for the young teacher.</p>

<p>The hour for the meeting drew near. As Esther approached
the schoolhouse, she found perhaps forty people,
men, women and children, grouped near the door.
Some of the children ran to meet her, Wathemah, the
little Indian, outrunning all of them. He trudged along
proudly by his teacher's side.</p>

<p>Esther Bright heard groans and hisses. As she
looked at the faces before her, two stood out with
peculiar distinctness,&mdash;one, a proud, high-bred face; the
other, a handsome, though dissipated one.</p>

<p>There were more hisses and then muttered insults.
There was no mistaking the sounds or meaning. The
Indian child sprang forward, transformed into a fury.
He shook his little fist at the men, as he shouted,
"Ye Wathemah teacher hurt, Wathemah kill ye
blankety blanked devils."</p>

<p>A coarse laugh arose from several men.</p>

<p>"What're yer givin' us, kid?" said one man, staggering
forward.</p>

<p>"Wathemah show ye, ye blankety blanked devil,"
shrieked he again.</p>

<p>Wild with rage, the child rushed forward, uttering
oaths that made his teacher shudder. She too stepped
rapidly forward, and clasped her arms about him.
He fought desperately for release, but she held him,
speaking to him in low, firm tones, apparently trying
to quiet him. At last, he burst into tears of anger.</p>

<p>For a moment, the mutterings and hisses ceased, but
they burst forth again with greater strength. The
child sprang from his teacher, leaped like a squirrel to
the back of one of the ruffians, climbed to his shoulder,
and dealt lightning blows upon his eyes and nose and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
mouth. The man grasped him and hurled him with
terrific force to the ground. The little fellow lay in a
helpless heap where he had fallen. Esther rushed to the
child and bent over him. All the brute seemed roused
in the drunken man. He lunged toward her with
menacing fists, and a torrent of oaths.</p>

<p>"Blank yer!" he said, "Yer needn't interfere with
me. Blank y'r hide. Yer'll git out o' Gila ter-morrer,
blank yer!"</p>

<p>But he did not observe the three stern faces at the
right and left of Esther Bright and the prostrate child.
Three men with guns drawn protected them.</p>

<p>The men who had come to insult and annoy knew well
that if they offered further violence to the young teacher
and the unconscious child, they would have to reckon
with John Clayton, Kenneth Hastings and John Harding.
Wordless messages were telegraphed from eye to
eye, and one by one the ruffians disappeared.</p>

<p>Esther still knelt by Wathemah. He had been
stunned by the fall. Water revived him; and after a
time, he was able to walk into the schoolhouse.</p>

<p>Oh, little child of the Open, so many years misunderstood,
how generously you respond with love to a
little human kindness! How bitterly you resent a
wrong!</p>

<p>Afterwards, in describing what Miss Bright did during
this trying ordeal, a Scotch miner said:</p>

<p>"The lass's smile fair warmed the heart. It was na
muckle, but when she comforted the Indian bairn I
could na be her enemy."</p>

<p>As Esther entered the door, she saw two middle-aged
Scotch women clasp hands and exchange words of greeting.
She did not dream then, nor did she know until
months after, how each of these longed for her old home
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
in Scotland; nor did she know, at that time, how the
heart of each one of them had warmed towards her.</p>

<p>Several women and children and a few men followed
the teacher into the schoolroom. All looked around
curiously.</p>

<p>Esther looked into the faces before her, some dull,
others hard; some worn by toil and exposure; others
disfigured by dissipation. They were to her, above
everything else, human beings to be helped; and ministration
to their needs became of supreme interest to her.</p>

<p>There were several Scotch people in the audience.
As the books and lesson leaves were passed, Esther gave
out a hymn the children knew, and which she fancied
might be familiar to the Scotch people present,&mdash;"My
Ain Countrie."</p>

<p>She lifted her guitar, played a few opening chords,
and sang,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"I am far frae my hame, an' I'm weary aftenwhiles<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For the longed-for hame-bringin', an' my Faither's welcome smiles;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">An' I'll ne'er be fu' content, until mine een do see<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The gowden gates o' Heaven, an' my ain countrie."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At first a few children sang with her, but finding their
elders did not sing, they, too, stopped to listen.</p>

<p>The two Scotch women, who sat side by side, listened
intently. One reached out and clasped the hand of
the other; and then, over the cheeks furrowed by toil, privation
and heart-hunger, tears found their unaccustomed
way.</p>

<p>The singer sang to the close of the stanza, then urged
all to sing with her. A sturdy Scotchman, after clearing
his throat, spoke up:</p>

<p>"Please, Miss, an' will ye sing it all through y'rsel?
It reminds me o' hame."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Applause followed. The singer smiled, then lifting
her guitar, sang in a musical voice, the remaining
stanzas.</p>

<p>When she prayed, the room grew still. The low,
tender voice was speaking as to a loving, compassionate
Father. One miner lifted his head to see the Being she
addressed, and whose presence seemed to fill the room.
All he saw was the shining face of the teacher. Months
later, he said confidentially to a companion that he would
acknowledge that though he had never believed in "such
rot as a God an' all them things," yet when the teacher
prayed that day, he somehow felt that there was a God,
and that he was right there in that room. And he
added:</p>

<p>"I felt mighty queer. I reckon I wasn't quite ready
ter have Him look me through an' through."</p>

<p>From similar testimony given by others at various
times, it is clear that many that day heard themselves
prayed for for the first time in their lives. And they
did not resent it.</p>

<p>The prayer ended. A hush followed. Then the lesson
of the day was taught, and the school was organized.
At the close, the teacher asked all who wished to help
in the Bible school to remain a few moments.</p>

<p>Many came to express their good will. One Scotch
woman said, "I dinna wonder the bairns love ye. Yir talk the
day was as gude as the sermons i' the Free Kirk at
hame."</p>

<p>Then another Scotch woman took both of Esther
Bright's hands in her own, and assured her it was a long
day since she had listened to the Word.</p>

<p>"But," she added, "whatever Jane Carmichael can
dae tae help ye, Lassie, she'll dae wi' a' her heart."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>The first of the two stepped forward, saying apologetically,
"I forgot tae say as I am Mistress Burns, mither o'
Marget an' Jamesie."</p>

<p>"And I," added the other, "am the mither o'
Donald."</p>

<p>Mr. Clayton, elected superintendent at the organization
of the Bible school, now joined the group about the
teacher. At last the workers only remained, and after
a brief business meeting, they went their several ways.
Evidently they were thinking new thoughts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Burns overtook Mrs. Carmichael and remarked
to her, "I dinna ken why the Almighty came sae near my
heart the day, for I hae wandered. God be thankit,
that He has sent the lassie amang us."</p>

<p>"Aye," responded Mrs. Carmichael, "let us be thankfu',
an' come back hame tae God."</p>

<p>Esther Bright was the last to leave the schoolhouse.
As she strolled along slowly, deep in thought over the
events of the day, she was arrested by the magnificence
of the sunset. She stopped and stood looking into the
crystal clearness of the sky, so deep, so illimitable.
Across the heavens, which were suddenly aflame with
crimson and gold, floated delicate, fleecy clouds. Soon,
all the colors of the rainbow were caught and softened
by these swift-winged messengers of the sky. Away
on the mountains, the snow glowed as if on fire. Slowly
the colors faded. Still she stood, with face uplifted.
Then she turned, her face shining, as though she had
stood in the very presence of God.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in her path, stepped the little Indian, his
arms full of goldenrod. He waited for her, saying as
he offered the flowers:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Flowers</i>, me teacher."</p>

<p>She stooped, drew him to her, and kissed his dirty
face, saying as she did so, "Flowers? How lovely!"</p>

<p>He clasped her hand, and they walked on together.</p>

<p>The life story of the little Indian had deeply touched
her. It was now three years since he had been found,
a baby of three, up in Line Canyon. That was just
after one of the Apache raids. It was believed that he
was the child of Geronimo. When the babe was discovered
by the white men who pursued the Indians, he was
blinking in the sun. A cowboy, one Jack Harding, had
insisted upon taking the child back to the camp with
them. Then the boy had found a sort of home in
Keith's saloon, where he had since lived. There he had
been teased and petted, and cuffed and beaten, and cursed
by turns, and being a child of unusually bright mind,
and the constant companion of rough men, he had
learned every form of evil a child can possibly know.
His naturally winsome nature had been changed by
teasing and abuse until he seemed to deserve the sobriquet
they gave him,&mdash;"little savage." Now at the
age of perhaps six years, he had been sent to the Gila
school; and there Esther Bright found him. The
teacher was at once attracted to the child.</p>

<p>Many years after, when Wathemah had become a distinguished
man, he would tell how his life began when
a lovely New England girl, a remarkable teacher, found
him in that little school in Gila. He never failed to
add that all that he was or might become, he owed entirely
to her.</p>

<p>The Indian child's devotion to the teacher began that
first day at school, and was so marked it drew upon
him persecution from the other children. Never could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
they make him ashamed. When the teacher was present,
he ignored their comments and glances, and carried
himself as proudly as a prince of the realm; but when
she was absent, many a boy, often a boy larger than
himself, staggered under his furious attacks. The child
had splendid physical courage. Take him for all in
all, he was no easy problem to solve. The teacher
studied him, listened to him, reasoned with him, loved
him; and from the first, he seemed to know intuitively
that she was to be trusted and obeyed.</p>

<p>On this day, he was especially happy as he trudged
along, his hand in that of his Beloved.</p>

<p>"Did you see how beautiful the sunset is, Wathemah?"
asked the teacher, looking down at the picturesque
urchin by her side. He gave a little grunt, and
looked into the sky.</p>

<p>"Flowers in sky," he said, his face full of delight.
"God canyon put flowers, he Wathemah love?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. God put flowers in the canyon because
he loves you."</p>

<p>They stopped, and both looked up into the sky.
Then, after a moment, she continued:</p>

<p>"You are like the flowers of the canyon, Wathemah.
God put you here for me to find and love."</p>

<p>"Love Wathemah?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Then she stooped and gathered him into her arms.
He nestled to her.</p>

<p>"You be Wathemah's mother?" he questioned.</p>

<p>She put her cheek against the little dirty one. The
child felt tears. As he patted her cheek with his dirty
hand, he repeated anxiously:</p>

<p>"Me teacher be Wathemah mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, as though making a sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
covenant, "I, Wathemah's teacher, promise to be
Wathemah's mother, so help me God."</p>

<p>The child was coming into his birthright, the birthright
of every child born into the world,&mdash;a mother's
love. Who shall measure its power in the development
of a child's life?</p>

<p>They had reached the Clayton home. Wathemah
turned reluctantly, lingering and drawing figures in
the road with his bare feet, a picture one would long
remember.</p>

<p>He was a slender child, full of sinuous grace. His
large, lustrous dark eyes, as well as his features, showed
a strain of Spanish blood. He was dressed in cowboy
fashion, but with more color than one sees in the cowboy
costume. His trousers were of brown corduroy,
slightly ragged. He wore a blue and white striped
blouse, almost new. Around his neck, tied jauntily in
front, was a red silk handkerchief, a gift from a cowboy.
He smoothed it caressingly, as though he delighted
in it. His straight, glossy black hair, except where
cut short over the forehead, fell to his shoulders.
Large loop-like ear-rings dangled from his ears; but
the crowning feature of his costume, and his especial
pride, was a new sombrero hat, trimmed with a scarlet
ribbon and a white quill. He suddenly looked at his
teacher, his face lighting with a radiant smile, and said:</p>

<p>"Mother, <i>me</i> mother."</p>

<p>"Tell me, Wathemah," she said, "what you learned
to-day in the Bible school."</p>

<p>He turned and said softly:</p>

<p>"Jesus love."</p>

<p>Then the little child of the Open walked back to the
camp, repeating softly to himself:</p>

<p>"Jesus love! Mother love!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>CLAYTON RANCH</h3>

<p class="cap">E<span class="smcap">arly</span> traders knew Clayton Ranch well, for
it was on the old stage route from Santa Fe
to the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>The house faced south, overlooking Gila
River, and commanded a magnificent view
of mountains and foothills and valleys. To the northeast,
rose a distant mountain peak always streaked
with snow.</p>

<p>The ranch house, built of blocks of adobe, was of
a creamy cement color resembling the soil of the surrounding
foothills. The building was long and low,
in the Spanish style of a rectangle, opening on a central
court at the rear. The red tile roof slanted
in a shallow curve from the peak of the house,
out over the veranda, which extended across the front.
Around the pillars that supported the roof of the veranda,
vines grew luxuriantly, and hung in profusion
from the strong wire stretched high from pillar to pillar.
The windows and doors were spacious, giving the place
an atmosphere of generous hospitality. Northeast of
the house, was a picturesque windmill, which explained
the abundant water supply for the ranch, and the freshness
of the vines along the irrigating ditch that bordered
the veranda. The dooryard was separated from
the highway by a low adobe wall the color of the house.
In the yard, palms and cacti gave a semi-tropical setting
to this attractive old building. Port-holes on two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
sides of the house bore evidence of its having been built
as a place of defense. Here, women and children had
fled for safety when the Apache raids filled everyone
with terror. Here they had remained for days, with
few to protect them, while the men of the region drove
off the Indians.</p>

<p>Senor Matéo, the builder and first owner of the house,
had been slain by the Apaches. On the foothills, just
north of the house, ten lonely graves bore silent witness
to that fatal day.</p>

<p>Up the road to Clayton Ranch, late one November
afternoon, came Esther Bright with bounding step, accompanied,
as usual, by a bevy of children. She heard
one gallant observe to another that their teacher was
"just a daisy."</p>

<p>Although this and similar compliments were interspersed
with miners' and cowboys' slang, they were
none the less respectful and hearty, and served to express
the high esteem in which the new teacher was
held by the little citizens of Gila.</p>

<p>As the company neared the door of the Clayton home,
one little girl suddenly burst forth:</p>

<p>"My maw says she won't let her childern go ter Bible
school ter be learned 'ligion by a Gentile. Me an' Mike
an' Pat an' Brigham wanted ter go, but maw said, maw
did, that she'd learn us Brigham Young's 'ligion, an'
no sech trash as them Gentiles tells about; 'n' that the
womern as doesn't have childern'll never go ter Heaven,
maw says. My maw's got ten childern. My maw's
Mormon."</p>

<p>Here little Katie Black paused for breath. She was
a stocky, pug-nosed, freckle-faced little creature, with
red hair, braided in four short pugnacious pigtails,
tied with white rags.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"So your mother is a Mormon?" said the teacher
to Katie.</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"Suppose I come to see your mother, Katie, and tell
her all about it. She might let you come. Shall I?"</p>

<p>Her question was overheard by one of Katie's
brothers, who said heartily:</p>

<p>"Sure! I'll come fur yer. Maw said yer was too
stuck up ter come, but I said I knowed better."</p>

<p>"Naw," said Brigham, "she ain't stuck up; be yer?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit." The teacher's answer seemed to give
entire satisfaction to the company.</p>

<p>The children gathered about her as they reached the
door of Clayton Ranch. Esther Bright placed her
hand on Brigham's head. It was a loving touch, and
her "Good night, laddie," sent the child on his way
happy.</p>

<p>Within the house, all was cheer and welcome. The
great living room was ablaze with light. A large open
fireplace occupied the greater part of the space on one
side. There, a fire of dry mesquite wood snapped and
crackled, furnishing both light and heat this chill November
evening.</p>

<p>The floor of the living room was covered with an
English three-ply carpet. The oak chairs were both
substantial and comfortable. On the walls, hung three
oil paintings of English scenes. Here and there were
bookcases, filled with standard works. On a round table
near the fireplace, were strewn magazines and papers. A
comfortable low couch, piled with sofa pillows, occupied
one side of the room near the firelight. Here, resting
from a long and fatiguing journey, was stretched John
Clayton, the owner of the house.</p>

<p>As Esther Bright entered the room, he rose and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
greeted her cordially. His manner indicated the well-bred
man of the world. He was tall and muscular, his
face, bronzed from the Arizona sun. There was something
very genial about the man that made him a delightful
host.</p>

<p>"Late home, Miss Bright!" he said in playful reproof.
"This is a rough country, you know."</p>

<p>"So I hear, mine host," she said, bowing low in mock
gravity, "and that is why we have been scared to death
at your long absence. I feared the Indians had carried
you off."</p>

<p>"I was detained unwillingly," he responded. "But,
really, Miss Bright, I am not joking. It <i>is</i> perilous for
you to tramp these mountain roads as you do, and especially
near nightfall. You are tempting Providence."
He nodded his head warningly.</p>

<p>"But I am not afraid," she persisted.</p>

<p>"I know that. More's the pity. But you ought to
be. Some day you may be captured and carried off,
and no one in camp to rescue you."</p>

<p>"How romantic!" she answered, a smile lurking in
her eyes and about her mouth.</p>

<p>She seated herself on a stool near the fire.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you ask me why I was so late? I have
an excellent excuse."</p>

<p>"Why, prisoner at the bar?"</p>

<p>"Please, y'r honor, we've been making ready for
Christmas." She assumed the air of a culprit, and
looked so demurely funny he laughed outright.</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Clayton and Edith, her fifteen-year-old
daughter, entered the room.</p>

<p>"What's the fun?" questioned Edith.</p>

<p>"Miss Bright is pleading guilty to working more
hours than she should."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no, I didn't, Edith," she said merrily. "I
said we had been making ready for Christmas."</p>

<p>Edith sat on a stool at her teacher's side. She, too,
was ready for a tilt.</p>

<p>"You're not to pronounce sentence, Mr. Judge, until
you see what we have been doing. It's to be a great
surprise." And Edith looked wise and mysterious.</p>

<p>Then Esther withdrew, returning a little later,
gowned in an old-rose house dress of some soft wool
stuff. She again sat near the fire.</p>

<p>"Papa," said Edith, "I have been telling Miss
Bright about the annual Rocky Mountain ball, and that
she must surely go."</p>

<p>John Clayton looked amused.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Edith couldn't do justice to that social
function. I am quite sure you never saw anything like
it. It is the most primitive sort of a party, made up of
a motley crowd,&mdash;cowboys, cowlassies, miners and their
families, and ranchmen and theirs. They come early,
have a hearty supper, and dance all night; and as many
of them imbibe pretty freely, they sometimes come to
blows."</p>

<p>He seemed amused at the consternation in Esther's
face.</p>

<p>"You don't mean that I shall be expected to go to
such a party?" she protested.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"It seems dreadful," she hastened to say, "and besides
that, I never go to dances. I do not dance."</p>

<p>"It's not as bad as it sounds," explained John Clayton.
"You see these people are human. Their solitary
lives are barren of pleasure. They crave intercourse
with their kind; and so this annual party offers
this opportunity."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"And is this the extent of their social life? Have
they nothing better?"</p>

<p>"Nothing better," he said seriously, "but some
things much worse."</p>

<p>"I don't see how anything could be worse."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said, "it could be worse. But to return
to the ball. It is unquestionably a company of
publicans and sinners. If you wish to do settlement
work here, to study these people in their native haunts,
here they are. You will have an opportunity to meet
some poor creatures you would not otherwise meet.
Besides, this party is given for the benefit of the school.
The proceeds of the supper help support the school."</p>

<p>"Then I must attend?"</p>

<p>"I believe so. With your desire to help these
people, I believe it wise for you to go with us to the
ball. You remember how a great Teacher long ago
ate with publicans and sinners."</p>

<p>"Yes, I was just thinking of it. Christ studied people
as he found them; helped them where he found
them." She sat with bent head, thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Yes," John Clayton spoke gently, "Christ studied
them as he found them, helped them where he found
them."</p>

<p>He sometimes smiled at her girlish eagerness, while
more and more he marveled at her wisdom and ability.
She had set him to thinking; and as he thought, he
saw new duties shaping before him.</p>

<p>It may have been an hour later, as they were reading
aloud from a new book, they heard a firm, quick
step on the veranda, followed by a light knock.</p>

<p>"It's Kenneth," exclaimed John Clayton in a brisk,
cheery tone, as he hastened to open the door. The
newcomer was evidently a valued friend. Esther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
recognized in the distinguished looking visitor one of
the men who had protected her the day of the organization
of the Bible school.</p>

<p>John Clayton rallied him on his prolonged absence.
Mrs. Clayton told him how they had missed him, and
Edith chattered merrily of what had happened since
his last visit.</p>

<p>When he was presented to Esther Bright, she rose, and
at that moment, a flame leaped from the burning mesquite,
and lighted up her face and form. She was lovely.
The heat of the fire had brought a slight color to her
cheeks, and this was accentuated by her rose-colored
gown. Kenneth Hastings bowed low, lower than his
wont to women. For a moment his eyes met hers. His
glance was keen and searching. She met it calmly,
frankly. Then her lashes swept her cheeks, and her
color deepened.</p>

<p>They gathered about the hearth. Fresh sticks of
grease woods, and pine cones, thrown on the fire, sent
red and yellow and violet flames leaping up the chimney.
The fire grew hotter, and they were obliged to widen
their circle.</p>

<p>What better than an open fire to unlock the treasures
of the mind and heart, when friend converses with
friend? The glow of the embers seems to kindle the
imagination, until the tongue forgets the commonplaces
of daily life and grows eloquent with the
thoughts that lie hidden in the deeps of the soul.</p>

<p>Such converse as this held this group of friends in
thrall. Kenneth Hastings talked well, exceedingly
well. All the best stops in his nature were out.
Esther listened, at first taking little part in the conversation.
She was a good listener, an appreciative listener,
and therein lay some of her charm. When he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
addressed a remark to her, she noticed that he had fine
eyes, wonderful eyes, such eyes as belonged to Lincoln
and Webster.</p>

<p>One would have guessed Kenneth Hastings' age to
be about thirty. He was tall, rather slender and
sinewy, with broad, strong shoulders. He had a fine
head, proudly poised, and an intelligent, though stern
face. He was not a handsome man; there was, however,
an air of distinction about him, and he had a
voice of rare quality, rich and musical. Esther Bright
had noticed this.</p>

<p>The visitor began to talk to her. His power to draw
other people out and make them shine was a fine art
with him. His words were like a spark to tinder.
Esther's mind kindled. She grew brilliant, and said
things with a freshness and sparkle that fascinated
everyone. And Kenneth Hastings listened with deepening
interest.</p>

<p>His call had been prolonged beyond his usual hour
for leave-taking, when John Clayton brought Esther's
guitar, that happened to be in the room, and begged
her for a song. She blushed and hesitated.</p>

<p>"Do sing," urged the guest.</p>

<p>"I am not a trained musician," she protested.</p>

<p>But her host assured his friend that she surely could
sing. Then all clamored for a song.</p>

<p>Esther sat thrumming the strings.</p>

<p>"What shall I sing?"</p>

<p>"'Who is Sylvia,'" suggested Mrs. Clayton.</p>

<p>This she sang in a full, sweet voice. Her tone was
true.</p>

<p>"More, more," they insisted, clapping their hands.</p>

<p>"Just <i>one</i> more song," pleaded Edith.</p>

<p>"Do you sing, 'Drink to me only with thine eyes'?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
asked Kenneth. For answer, she struck the chords,
and sang; then she laid down the guitar.</p>

<p>"Please sing one of your American ballads. Sing
'Home, Sweet Home,'" he suggested.</p>

<p>She had been homesick all day, so there was a home-sigh
in her voice as she sang. Kenneth moved his chair
into the shadow, and watched her.</p>

<p>At last he rose to go; and with promises of an early
return, he withdrew.</p>

<p>Not to the saloon did he go that night, as had been
his custom since coming to the mining camp. He
walked on and on, out into the vast aloneness of the
mountains. Once in a while he stopped, and looked
down towards Clayton Ranch. At intervals he
whistled softly.&mdash;The strain was "Home, Sweet
Home."</p>

<p>John Clayton and his wife sat long before the fire
after Esther and Edith had retired. Mary Clayton
was a gentle being, with a fair, sweet English face.
And she adored her husband. They had been talking
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Any way, Mary," John Clayton was saying, "I believe
Miss Bright could make an unusually fine man of
Kenneth. I believe she could make him a better man,
too."</p>

<p>"That might be, John," she responded, "but you
wouldn't want so rare a soul as she is to marry him to
reform him, would you? She's like a snow-drop."</p>

<p>"No, like a rose," he suggested, "all sweet at the
heart. I'd really like to see her marry Kenneth.
In fact, I'd like to help along a little."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear! How could you?" And she looked
at him reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he asked. "Tell me honestly." He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
lifted her face and looked into it with lover-like tenderness.
"You like Kenneth, don't you? And we are
always glad to welcome him in our home."</p>

<p>"Y-e-s," she responded hesitatingly, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"I fear he frequents the saloons, and is sometimes in
company totally unworthy of him. In fact, I fear he
isn't good enough for Miss Bright. I can't bear to
think of her marrying any man less pure and noble
than she is herself."</p>

<p>He took his wife's hand in both of his.</p>

<p>"You forget, Mary," he said, "that Miss Bright is
a very unusual woman. There are few men, possibly,
who are her peers. Don't condemn Kenneth because
he isn't exactly like her. He's not perfect, I admit,
any more than the rest of us. But he's a fine, manly
fellow, with a good mind and noble traits of character.
If the right woman gets hold of him, she'll make him a
good man, and possibly a great one."</p>

<p>"That may be," she said, "but I don't want Miss
Bright to be that woman."</p>

<p>"Suppose he were your son, would you feel he was
so unworthy of her?"</p>

<p>"Probably not," came her hesitating answer.</p>

<p>"Mary, dear," he said, "I fear you are too severe
in your judgment of men. I wish you had more compassion.
You see, it is this way: many who seem evil
have gone astray because they have not had the influence
of a good mother or sister or wife." He bent his head
and kissed her.</p>

<p>A moment later, he leaned back and burst into a
hearty laugh.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter?" she asked. "I don't
think it's a laughing matter."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's so ridiculous, Mary. Here we've been concerning
ourselves about the possible marriage of Kenneth
and Miss Bright, when they have only just met, and
it isn't likely they'll ever care for each other, anyway.
Let's leave them alone."</p>

<p>And the curtain went down on a vital introductory
scene in the drama of life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>THE ANGEL OF THE GILA</h3>

<p class="cap">D<span class="smcap">ays</span> came and went. The Bible school of
Gila had ceased to be an experiment. It
was a fact patent to all that the adobe
schoolhouse had become the social center of
the community, and that the soul of that
center was Esther Bright. She had studied sociology in
college and abroad. She had theorized, as many do,
about life; now, life itself, in its bald reality, was appealing
to her heart and brain. She did not stop to
analyze her fitness for the work. She indulged in no
morbid introspection. It was enough for her that she
had found great human need. She was now to cope,
almost single handed, with the forces that drag men
down. She saw the need, she realized the opportunity.
She worked with the quiet, unfailing patience of a
great soul, leaving the fruitage to God.</p>

<p>Sometimes the seriousness in Esther's face would
deepen. Then she would go out into the Open. On
one of these occasions, she strayed to her favorite haunt
in the timber along the river, and seated herself on the
trunk of a dead cottonwood tree, lying near the river
bank. Trees, covered with green mistletoe, towered
above her. Tremulous aspens sparkled in the sunshine.
The air was crystal clear; the vast dome of the sky,
of the deepest blue. She sat for a long time with face
lifted, apparently forgetful of the open letter in her
hand. At last she turned to it, and read as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Lynn, Mass.</span>, Tenth Month, Fifth Day, 1888.</p>
<p class="just">
<span class="smcap">My Beloved Granddaughter</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>Thy letter reached me Second Day. Truly thou hast found a
field that needs a worker, and I do not question that the Lord's
hand led thee to Gila. What thou art doing and dost plan to
do, interest me deeply; but it will tax thy strength. I am
thankful that thou hast felt a deepening sense of God's nearness.
His world is full of Him, only men's eyes are holden that they
do not know. All who gain strength to lead and inspire their
fellows, learn this surely at last:&mdash;that the soul of man finds
God most surely in the Open. If men would help their fellows,
they must seek inspiration and strength in communion with God.</p>

<p>To keep well, one must keep his mind calm and cheerful. So
I urge thee not to allow the sorrowfulness of life about thee to
depress thee. Thou canst not do thy most effective work if thy
heart is always bowed down. The great sympathy of thy nature
will lead thee to sorrow for others more than is well for thee.
Joy is necessary to all of us. So, Beloved, cultivate joyousness,
and teach others to do so. It keeps us sane, and strong and
helpful.</p>

<p>I know that the conditions thou hast found shock and distress
thee, as they do all godly men and women; but I beg thee to remember,
Esther, that our Lord had compassion on such as these,
on the sinful as well as on the good, and that He offers salvation
to all. How to have compassion! Ah, my child, men are
so slow in learning that. Love,&mdash;compassion, is the key of
Christ's philosophy.</p>

<p>I am often lonely without thee; but do not think I would call
thee back while the Lord hath need of thee.</p>

<p>Thy Uncle and Aunt are well, and send their love to thee.</p>

<p>I have just been reading John Whittier's 'Our Master.' Read
it on next First Day, as my message to thee.</p>

<p>God bless thee.
</p>

<p class="middle">
Thy faithful grandfather,</p>
<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">David Bright.</span>
</p>
</div>

<p>As she read, her eyes filled.</p>

<p>In the veins of Esther Bright flowed the blood of
honorable, God-fearing people; but to none of these,
had humanity's needs called more insistently than to
her. Her grandfather had early recognized and fostered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
her passion for service; and from childhood up,
he had frequently taken her with him on his errands of
mercy, that she might understand the condition and
the needs of the unfortunate. Between the two there
existed an unusual bond.</p>

<p>After reading the letter, Esther sat absorbed in
thought. The present had slipped away, and it seemed
as though her spirit had absented itself from her body
and gone on a far journey. She was aroused to a consciousness
of the present by a quick step. In a moment
Kenneth Hastings was before her; then, seated at her
side.</p>

<p>"Well!" he began. "How fortunate I am! Here
I was on my way to call on you to give you these
flowers. I've been up on the mountains for them."</p>

<p>"What beautiful mountain asters!" was her response,
her face lighting with pleasure. "How exquisite
in color! And how kind of you!"</p>

<p>"Yes, they're lovely." He looked into her face with
undisguised admiration. Something within her shrank
from it.</p>

<p>Three weeks had now passed since the meeting of
Kenneth Hastings and Esther Bright. During this
time, he had become an almost daily caller at Clayton
Ranch. When he made apologies for the frequency
of his calls, the Claytons always assured him of the
pleasure his presence gave them, saying he was to them
a younger brother, and as welcome.</p>

<p>It was evident to them that Kenneth's transformation
had begun. John Clayton knew that important
changes were taking place in his daily life; that all
his social life was spent in their home; that he had
ceased to enter a saloon; and that he had suddenly become
fastidious about his toilet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>If Esther noted any changes in him, she did not express
it. She was singularly reticent in regard to him.</p>

<p>At this moment, she sat listening to him as he told
her of the mountain flora.</p>

<p>"Wait till you see the cactus blossoms in the spring
and summer." He seemed very enthusiastic. "They
make a glorious mass of color against the soft gray of the
dry grass, or soil."</p>

<p>"I'd love to see them." She lifted the bunch of
asters admiringly.</p>

<p>"I have some water colors of cacti I made a year
ago. I'd like to show them to you, Miss Bright, if you
are interested."</p>

<p>She assured him she was.</p>

<p>"I was out in the region of Colorado River a year
ago. It is a wonderful region no white man has yet
explored. Only the Indians know of its greatness. I
have an idea that when that region is explored by some
scientist, he will discover that canyon to be the greatest
marvel of the world. What I saw was on a stupendous,
magnificent scale."</p>

<p>"How it must have impressed you!"</p>

<p>"Wonderfully! I'll show you a sketch I made of a
bit of what I found. It may suggest the magnificence
of the coloring to you."</p>

<p>"How did you happen to have sketching materials
with you?"</p>

<p>"I agreed to write a series of articles for an English
magazine, and wished illustrations for one of the articles."</p>

<p>"How accomplished you are!" she exclaimed. "A
mining engineer, a painter, an author&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't!" he protested, raising a deprecatory hand.</p>

<p>Having launched on the natural wonders of Arizona,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
he grew more and more eloquent, till Esther's imagination
made a daring leap, and she looked down the
gigantic gorge he pictured to her, over great acres of
massive rock formation, like the splendor of successive
day-dawns hardened into stone, and saw gigantic forms
chiseled by ages of erosion.</p>

<p>"Do you ride horseback, Miss Bright?" he asked,
suddenly changing the conversation.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say that I do not. I do not even
know how to mount."</p>

<p>"Let me teach you to ride," he said, with sudden
interest.</p>

<p>"You would find me an awkward pupil," she responded,
rising.</p>

<p>"I am willing to wager that I should not. When
may I have the pleasure of giving you the first lesson?"</p>

<p>"Any time convenient for you when I am not teaching."
She began to gather up her flowers and hat.</p>

<p>Then and there, a day was set for the first lesson in
horsemanship.</p>

<p>"Sit down, please," said Kenneth. "I want you
to enlighten me. I am painfully dense."</p>

<p>She seated herself on the tree trunk again, saying as
she did so:</p>

<p>"I had not observed any conspicuous signs of density
on your part, Mr. Hastings, save that you think I
could be metamorphosed into a horsewoman. Some
women are born to the saddle. I was not. I am not an
Englishwoman, you see."</p>

<p>"But decidedly English," he retorted. "I wish you
would tell me your story."</p>

<p>Her face flushed.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," he hastened to say. "I did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
not mean to be rude. You interest me deeply. Anything
you think or do, anything that has made you what
you are, is of deep interest to me."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to tell," she said simply. "Just
a few pages, with here and there an entry; a few birthdays;
graduation from college; foreign travel; work in
Gila; a life spent in companionship with a wonderfully
lovely and lovable grandfather; work at his side, and
life's history in the making. That is all."</p>

<p>"All?" he repeated. "But that is rich in suggestion.
I have studied you almost exclusively for three weeks,
and I know you."</p>

<p>She looked up. The expression in his eyes nettled
her. Her spinal column stiffened.</p>

<p>"Indeed! Know a woman in three weeks! You do
well, better than most of your sex. Most men, I am
told, find woman an unsolvable problem, and when they
think they know her, they find they don't."</p>

<p>This was interesting to him. He liked the flash in her
eye.</p>

<p>"Some life purpose brings you to Gila, to work so
unselfishly for a lot of common, ignorant people."</p>

<p>"What is that to you?"</p>

<p>Her question sounded harsh in her own ears, and
then she begged his pardon.</p>

<p>"No apology is necessary on your part," he said,
changing from banter to a tone of seriousness. "My
words roused your resentment. I am at fault. The
coming of a delicately nurtured girl like you into such
a place of degradation is like the coming of an angel of
light down to the bottomless pit. I beg forgiveness for
saying this; but, Miss Bright, a mining camp, in these
days, is a hotbed of vice."</p>

<p>"All the more reason why people of intelligence and
character should try to make the life here clean. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
believe we can crowd out evil by cultivating the good."</p>

<p>"You are a decided optimist," he said; "and I, by
force of circumstances, have become a confirmed pessimist."</p>

<p>"You will not continue to be a pessimist," she said,
prophetically, seeing in her mind's eye what he would
be in the years to come. "You will come to know deep
human sympathy; you will believe in the possibility
of better and better things for your fellows. You will
use your strength, your intellect, your fine education,
for the best service of the world about you."</p>

<p>Somehow that prophecy went home to him.</p>

<p>"By George!" he exclaimed, "you make a fellow feel
he <i>must</i> be just what you want him to be, and what he
ought to be."</p>

<p>The man studied the woman before him, with deep
and increasing interest. She possessed a strength, he
was sure, of which no one in Gila had yet dreamed. He
continued:</p>

<p>"Would you mind telling me the humanitarian
notions that made you willing to bury yourself in this
godless place?"</p>

<p>She hesitated. The catechism evidently annoyed her,
for it seemed to savor of impertinent curiosity. But
at last she answered:</p>

<p>"I believe my grandfather is responsible for the humanitarian
notions. It is a long story."</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>"I am interested in what he has done, and what you
are doing. Please tell me about it."</p>

<p>"Well, it goes back to my childhood. I was my
grandfather's constant companion until I went to college.
He is a well-known philanthropist of New England,
interested in the poor, in convicts in prison and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
out, in temperance work, in the enfranchisement of
woman, in education, and in everything that makes for
righteousness."</p>

<p>She paused.</p>

<p>"And he discussed great questions with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as though in counsel. He would tell me certain
conditions, and ask me what I thought we had
better do."</p>

<p>"An ideal preparation for philanthropic service."
He was serious now.</p>

<p>"There awoke within me, very early, the purpose to
serve my fellow men in the largest possible way. Grandfather
fostered this; and when the time came for me
to go to college, he helped me plan my course of study."
She looked far away.</p>

<p>"You followed it out?"</p>

<p>"Very nearly. You see, Mr. Hastings, service is no
accident with me. It dates back generations. It is
in my blood."</p>

<p>"Your blood is of the finest sort. Surely service does
not mean living in close touch with immoral, disreputable
people."</p>

<p>Her eyes kindled, grew dark in color.</p>

<p>"What <i>does</i> it mean, then? The strong, the pure,
the godly should live among men, teach by precept and
example how to live, and show the loveliness of pure
living just as Jesus did. I have visited prisons with
grandfather, have prayed with and for criminals, and
have sung in the prisons. Is it not worth while to help
these wretched creatures look away from themselves to
God?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Bright," he protested, "it is dreadful for
a young girl like you even to hear of the wickedness
of men."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Women are wicked, too," she responded seriously,
"but I never lose hope for any one."</p>

<p>"Some day hope will die out in your heart," he said
discouragingly.</p>

<p>"God forbid!" she spoke solemnly. In a moment she
continued:</p>

<p>"I am sure you do not realize how many poor creatures
never have had a chance to be decent. Just think
how many are born of sinful, ignorant parents, into
an environment of sin and ignorance. They live in it,
they die in it. I, by no will or merit of my own, received
a blessed heritage. My ancestors for generations
have been intelligent, godly people, many of them people
of distinction. I was born into an atmosphere of love,
of intelligence, of spirituality, and of refinement. I
have lived in that atmosphere all my life. My good
impulses have been fostered, my wrong ones checked."</p>

<p>"I'll wager you were painfully conscientious," he
said.</p>

<p>"Why should I have been given so much," she continued,
"and these poor creatures so little, unless it
was that I should minister to their needs?"</p>

<p>"You may be right." He seemed unconvinced.
"But I am sure of one thing. If I had been your
grandfather, and you my grandchild, I never would
have let you leave me."</p>

<p>He was smiling.</p>

<p>"You should know my grandfather, and then you
would understand."</p>

<p>"How did you happen to come to Gila?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I met Mr. and Mrs. Clayton in the home of one of
their friends in England. We were house guests there
at the same time. We returned to America on the same
steamer. Mrs. Clayton knew I was to do settlement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
work, and urged me to come to Gila a while instead. So
I came."</p>

<p>How much her coming was beginning to mean to him,
to others! Both were silent a while. Then it was
Kenneth who spoke.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Miss Bright, it never occurred to me
before you came, that I had any obligations to these
people? Now I know I have. I was indifferent to the
fact that I had a soul myself until you came."</p>

<p>She looked up questioningly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I mean it," he said. "To all intents and purposes
I had no soul. A man forgets he has a soul when
he lives in the midst of vice, and no one cares whether
he goes to the devil or not."</p>

<p>"Is it the environment, or the feeling that no one
cares?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Both." He buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>"Did you feel that no one cared? I'm sure your
mother cared."</p>

<p>She had touched a sore spot.</p>

<p>"My mother?" he said, bitterly. "My mother is a
woman of the world." Here he lifted his head. "She
is engrossed in society. She has no interest whatever
in me, and never did have, although I am her only
child."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are mistaken," she said softly. "I am
sure you must be mistaken."</p>

<p>"When a mother lets year after year go by without
writing to her son, do you think she cares?"</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that you never receive a
letter from your mother?"</p>

<p>"My mother has not written to me since I came to
America. Suppose your mother did not write to you.
Would you think she had a very deep affection for you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Esther's face grew wistful.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you do not know," she answered, "I have
no living mother. She died when I was born."</p>

<p>"Forgive my thoughtless question," he said. "I did
not know you had lost your mother. I was selfish."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she said, "not selfish. You didn't know,
that was all. We sometimes make mistakes, all of us,
when we do not know. I lost my father when I was
a very little child."</p>

<p>"And your grandfather reared you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, grandfather, assisted by my uncle and auntie."</p>

<p>"Tell me about your grandfather, I like to hear."</p>

<p>"He was my first playfellow, and a fine one he was,
too."</p>

<p>"How I envy him!"</p>

<p>"You mustn't interrupt me," she said demurely.</p>

<p>"I am penitent. Do proceed."</p>

<p>Then she told him, in brief, the story of her life,
simple and sweet in the telling. She told him of the
work done by her grandfather.</p>

<p>"He preaches, you tell me."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, rambling on, "he is a graduate of
Yale, and prepared to be a physician. But his heart
drew him into the ministry, the place where he felt
the Great Physician would have him be. Grandfather
is a Friend, you know, a Quaker."</p>

<p>"So I understood."</p>

<p>"He had a liberal income, so it was possible for him
to devote his entire time to the poor and distressed. He
has been deeply interested in the Negro and American
Indian, and in fact, in every one who is oppressed by
his stronger brother."</p>

<p>"An unusual man."</p>

<p>"Very."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"How could you leave him? Did you not feel that
your first duty was to him?"</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> hard to leave him," she said, while her eyes
were brimming with tears; "but grandfather and I believe
that opportunity to serve means obligation to
serve. Besides, love is such a spiritual thing we can
never be separated."</p>

<p>"Love is such a spiritual thing&mdash;" he repeated, and
again, "Spiritual."</p>

<p>He was silent a moment, then he spoke abruptly.</p>

<p>"You have already been the salvation of at least one
soul. I owe my soul to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not to me," she protested. "That was God's
gift to you from the beginning. It may have slumbered,
but you had it all the while."</p>

<p>"What did your grandfather say to your coming to
Gila?"</p>

<p>"When I told him of the call to come here, told him
that within a radius of sixty miles there was no place
of religious worship, he made no response, but sat with
his head bowed. At last he looked up with the most
beautiful smile you ever saw, and said, 'Go, my child,
the Lord hath need of thee.'" Her voice trembled a
little.</p>

<p>"He was right," said Kenneth earnestly. "The
Lord has need of such as you everywhere. I have need
of you. The people here have need of you. Help us
to make something of our lives yet, Miss Bright."
There was no doubting his sincerity.</p>

<p>She had again risen to go.</p>

<p>"Don't go," he said. "I would like to tell you <i>my</i>
story, if you care to hear."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to hear your story. I know it will
not be as meager as mine."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish," he said earnestly, "that I might measure
up to your ideal of what a man should be. I cannot
do that. But I can be honest and tell you the truth
about myself.</p>

<p>"I belong to a proud, high-strung race of people. My
father is like his forbears. He is a graduate of Cambridge;
has marked literary ability.</p>

<p>"My mother is a society woman, once noted as a
beauty at court. She craves admiration and must have
it. That is all she cares for. She has never shown
any affection for my father or me.</p>

<p>"I left England when I was twenty-two,&mdash;my senior
year at Cambridge. I've been in America eight years,
and during that time I have received but two letters
from home, and those were from my father."</p>

<p>"You must have felt starved."</p>

<p>"That's it," he said, "<i>starved</i>! I did feel starved.
You see, Miss Bright, a fellow's home has much to do
with his life and character. What is done there influences
him. Wine was served on our table. My parents
partook freely of it; so did our guests. I have
seen some guests intoxicated. We played cards, as all
society people do. We played for stakes, also. You call
that gambling. My mother's men admirers were mush-headed
fools."</p>

<p>"Such conditions obtain in certain circles in this
country, too. They are a menace to the American
home," she said gravely.</p>

<p>"I was sent to Cambridge," he continued, "as my
father and his father, and father's father before him,
had been sent. I was a natural student and always did
well in my work. But my drinking and gambling
finally got me into trouble. I was fired. My father
was so incensed at my dismissal he told me never to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
darken his doors again. He gave me money, and told
me to leave at once for America.</p>

<p>"I went to my mother's room to bid her good-by.
She stood before a mirror while her maid was giving
the final touches to her toilet. She looked regal and
beautiful as she stood there, and I felt proud of her. I
told her what had happened, and that I had come to bid
her good-by. She turned upon me pettishly, and asked
me how I could mar her pleasure just as she was going
to a ball. Her last words to me were, 'I hate to be
disturbed with family matters!'"</p>

<p>"Did she bid you good-by?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Forget it," she urged. "All women are not like that.
I hope you will find some rare woman who will be as a
mother to you."</p>

<p>"Forget it!" he repeated bitterly. "I can't."</p>

<p>"But you will sometime. You came to America.
What next?"</p>

<p>"Then I entered the School of Mines at Columbia,
and took my degree the following year, after which I
joined Mr. Clayton here. That was seven years ago."</p>

<p>"Did you know him in England?"</p>

<p>"Yes. During these intervening years I have frequented
the saloons. I have drank some, gambled some,
as I did at home. And I have mingled with disreputable
men here, but not to lift them up. I have not cared,
chiefly because I knew no one else cared."</p>

<p>His companion was silent.</p>

<p>"You despise me, Miss Bright," he continued. "I
deserve your contempt, I know. But I would do anything
in the power of man to do now, if I could undo
the past, and have a life as blameless as your own."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>He glanced at his companion.</p>

<p>"What a brute I have been," he exclaimed, "to pour
my ugly story into your ears!"</p>

<p>"I am glad you told me," she assured him. She
looked up with new sympathy and understanding.
"You are going to live down your past now, Mr. Hastings.
We'll begin here and now. You will not speak
of this again unless it may be a relief to you. The
matter will not cross my lips."</p>

<p>She flashed upon him a radiant smile. She believed
in him. He could hardly comprehend it.</p>

<p>"You do not despise me? You forgive my past?"
He looked into her face.</p>

<p>"It is God who forgives. Why should I despise
whom God forgives?"</p>

<p>"If ever I find my way to God," he said in a low
voice, "it will be through you."</p>

<p>She quoted softly:</p>

<p>"'Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as
white as snow; though they be red as crimson, they shall
be as wool.'" Then she added, "I must go home
now."</p>

<p>They walked on to Clayton Ranch. After a few
commonplaces, Kenneth lifted his hat, and turning,
walked swiftly toward the company's headquarters.</p>

<p>Esther stood a moment, watching the easy, graceful
stride of the young engineer. His words then, and long
afterwards, rang in her ears,&mdash;"Help us to make something
of our lives yet." And as the words echoed in
her heart, a voice aged and full of tender love, came to
her like an old refrain,&mdash;"Go, my child, the Lord hath
need of thee."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
She lifted her face and looked into the sky. Suddenly
she became conscious of the beauty of the hour.
The violet light of evening played about her face and
form. She forgot the flowers in her arms, forgot the sunset,
and stood absorbed in prayer.

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN BALL</h3>

<p class="cap">I<span class="smcap">t</span> was the day of the ball. Parties of mountaineers,
some on horseback, some in wagons, started
for Jamison Ranch.</p>

<p>In the early evening, a wagon load made up of
the members of the Clayton household, Kenneth
Hastings and some Scotch neighbors, started for the
same destination.</p>

<p>The road skirted the foothills for some distance, then
followed the canyon several miles; and then, branching
off, led directly to Jamison Ranch. As the twilight
deepened into night, Nature took on a solemn and
mysterious beauty. The rugged outline of the mountains,
the valley and river below,&mdash;were all idealized
in the softening light. The New England girl sat
drinking in the wonder of it all. The mountains were
speaking to her good tidings of great joy.</p>

<p>In the midst of merry chatter, some one called out:</p>

<p>"Sing us a song, Miss Bright."</p>

<p>It was Kenneth Hastings. Hearing her name, she
roused from her reverie.</p>

<p>"A song?"</p>

<p>"Yes, do sing," urged several.</p>

<p>"Sing 'Oft in the Stilly Night,'" suggested Mrs.
Clayton.</p>

<p>"All sing with me," responded Esther.</p>

<p>Then out on the stillness floated the beautiful old
Irish song. Other voices joined Esther's. Kenneth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Hastings was one of the singers. His voice blended
with hers and enriched it.</p>

<p>Song after song followed, all the company participating
to some extent in the singing.</p>

<p>Was it the majesty of the mountain scenery that inspired
Esther, that sent such a thrill of gladness into her
voice? Or was it perhaps the witchery of the moonlight?
Whatever may have been the cause, a new quality appeared
in her voice, and stirred the hearts of all who listened
to her singing; it was deep and beautiful.</p>

<p>What wonder if Kenneth Hastings came under the
spell of the song and the singer? The New England
girl was a breath of summer in the hard and wintry coldness
of his life.</p>

<p>"Who taught you to sing?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"The birds," she answered, in a joyous, laughing
tone.</p>

<p>"I can well believe that," he continued, "but who
were your other instructors?"</p>

<p>Then, in brief, she told him of her musical training.</p>

<p>Would she sing one of his favorite arias some day?
naming the aria.</p>

<p>She hummed a snatch of it.</p>

<p>"Go on," he urged.</p>

<p>"Not now; some other time."</p>

<p>"Won't you give us an evening recital soon?" asked
John Clayton.</p>

<p>And then and there the concert was arranged for.</p>

<p>"Miss Bright," said Mrs. Carmichael, "I am wondering
how we ever got on without you."</p>

<p>Esther laughed a light-hearted, merry laugh.</p>

<p>"That's it," Kenneth hastened to say. "We 'got
on.' We simply existed. Now we live."</p>

<p>All laughed at this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are not complimentary to our friends. I protest,"
said Esther.</p>

<p>"You are growing chivalrous, Kenneth," said Mrs.
Clayton. "I'm glad you think as we do. Miss Bright,
you have certainly enriched life for all of us."</p>

<p>"Don't embarrass me," said Esther in a tone that
betrayed she was a little disconcerted.</p>

<p>But now they were nearing their journey's end. The
baying of hounds announced a human habitation. An
instant later, the house was in sight, and the dogs came
bounding down the road, greeting the party with vociferous
barks and growls. Mr. Jamison followed, profuse
in words of welcome.</p>

<p>As Kenneth assisted Esther from the wagon, he said:</p>

<p>"Your presence during this drive has given me real
pleasure."</p>

<p>Her simple "Thank you" was her only response.</p>

<p>At the door they were met by daughters of the
house, buxom lasses, who ushered them into an immense
living room. This opened into two other rooms, one
of which had been cleared for dancing.</p>

<p>Esther noted every detail,&mdash;a new rag carpet on the
floor; a bright-colored log-cabin quilt on one of the beds;
on the other bed, was a quilt of white, on which was
appliqued a menagerie of nondescript animals of red
and green calico, capering in all directions. The particular
charm of this work of art was its immaculate
quilting,&mdash;quilting that would have made our great-grandmothers
green with envy.</p>

<p>Cheap yellow paper covered the walls of the room. A
chromo, "Fast Asleep," framed in heavy black walnut,
hung close to the ceiling. A sewing machine stood in
one corner.</p>

<p>At first, Esther did not notice the human element in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
the room. Suddenly a little bundle at the foot of the
bed began to grunt. She lifted it, and found a speck of
humanity about three months old. In his efforts to make
his wants known, and so secure his rightful attention,
he puckered his mouth, doubled up his fists, grew red in
the face, and let forth lusty cries.</p>

<p>As she stood trying to soothe the child, the mother
rushed in, snatched it from the teacher's arms, and gave
it a slap, saying as she did so, "The brat's allus screechin' when I wanter dance!"</p>

<p>She left the babe screaming vociferously, and returned
to dance. Four other infants promptly entered
into the vocal contest, while their respective parents
danced in the adjoining room, oblivious of everything
save the pleasure of the hour. Then it was that the New
England girl became a self-appointed nurse, patting
and soothing first one, then another babe; but it was
useless. They had been brought to the party under
protest; and offended humanity would not be mollified.</p>

<p>The teacher stepped out into the living room, which
was in festive array. Its picturesqueness appealed to
her. A large fire crackled on the hearth, and threw
its transforming glow over the dingy adobe walls, decorated
for the occasion with branches of fragrant silver
spruce. Blocks of pine tree-trunks, perhaps two feet
in height, stood in the corners of the room. Each of
these blocks contained a dozen or more candle sockets,
serving the purpose of a candelabrum. Each of the
sockets bore a lighted candle, which added to the weirdness
of the scene.</p>

<p>The room was a unique background for the men and
women gathered there. At least twenty of the mountaineers
had already assembled. They had come at late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
twilight, and would stay till dawn, for their journey lay
over rough mountain roads and through dangerous
passes.</p>

<p>The guests gathered rapidly, laughing and talking
as they came.</p>

<p>It was a motley crowd,&mdash;cowboys, in corduroy, high
boots, spurs, slouch hats, and knives at belt, brawny
specimens of human kind; cowlasses, who for the time,
had discarded their masculine attire of short skirts,
blouse, belt and gun, for feminine finery; Scotchmen in
Highland costume; Mexicans in picturesque dress; English
folk, clad in modest apparel; and Irishmen and
Americans resplendent in colors galore.</p>

<p>For a moment, Esther stood studying the novel scene.
Mr. Clayton, observing her, presented her to the individuals
already assembled. The last introduction was
to a shambling, awkward young miner. After shaking
the hand of the teacher, which he did with a vigor quite
commensurate to his elephantine strength, he blurted
out, "Will yez dance a polky wid me?"</p>

<p>She asked to be excused, saying she did not dance.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I can learn yez," he said eagerly. "Yez
put one fut so, and the other <i>so</i>," illustrating the step
with bovine grace as he spoke.</p>

<p>His efforts were unavailing, so he found a partner
among the cowlasses.</p>

<p>Again Esther was alone. She seated herself near
one of the improvised pine candelabra, and continued
to study the people before her. Here she found primitive
life indeed, life close to the soil. How to get at
these people, how to learn their natures, how to understand
their needs, how to help them,&mdash;all these questions
pressed upon her. Of this she was sure:&mdash;she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
must come in touch with them to help them. Men and
women older and more experienced than she might well
have knit their brows over the problem.</p>

<p>She was roused to a consciousness of present need by
a piercing cry from one of the infants in the adjoining
room. The helpless cry of a child could never appeal
in vain to such a woman as Esther Bright. She
returned to the bedroom, lifted the wailing bundle in
her arms, seated herself in a rocker, and proceeded to
quiet it. Kenneth Hastings stood watching her, while
an occasional smile flitted across his face. As John
Clayton joined him, the former said in a low tone:</p>

<p>"Do you see Miss Bright's new occupation, John?"</p>

<p>"Yes, by George! What will that girl do next?
Who but Miss Bright would bother about other people's
crying infants? But it's just like her! She is true
woman to the heart. I wish there were more like her."</p>

<p>"So do I, John. I wish I were more like her myself
in unselfish interest in people."</p>

<p>"She has done you great good already, Kenneth."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know."</p>

<p>Then a shadow darkened Kenneth's face. He moved
toward the outer door that stood open, and looked out
into the night.</p>

<p>At last Esther's task was accomplished, the babe was
asleep, and she returned to the scene of the dancing.
Kenneth sought her and asked her to dance the next
waltz with him. She assured him, also, that she did not
dance.</p>

<p>"Let me teach you," he urged. But she shook her
head.</p>

<p>"You do not approve of dancing?" he asked, lifting
his brows.</p>

<p>"I did not say I do not approve of dancing; I said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
I do not dance. By the way," she said, changing the
subject of the conversation, "my lessons in riding are
to begin to-morrow, are they not?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, if I may have the pleasure. Do you
think riding wicked, too?"</p>

<p>This he said with a sly twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>"Wicked, too?" she echoed. "What's the 'too'
mean?"</p>

<p>"Dancing, of course."</p>

<p>"But I didn't say I thought dancing wicked. I said
I do not dance."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you think it wicked, or you would dance."</p>

<p>She looked amused.</p>

<p>"What would you say if I should tell you I learned
to dance years ago?"</p>

<p>"That you are strait-laced obstinacy personified.
Why not dance? It could do you no harm."</p>

<p>"It is not expedient, that is all. Let me tell you I
really did learn. I am not an accomplished dancer,
though. I was taught to dance in a school I attended.
But I have never danced in social life."</p>

<p>"Why not put aside your scruples for once," he
urged, "and dance the next waltz with me? You
don't know what pleasure it would give me."</p>

<p>But she still refused. He saw that to pursue the
matter further would be useless. The conversation was
interrupted by the entrance of cowboys and cowlasses,
who, as they filed past, were presented to her by Kenneth
Hastings.</p>

<p>"How are ye?" asked one husky fellow, gripping
Esther's hand like a vise.</p>

<p>"Happy ter know yer acquaintance," said another.</p>

<p>The girls snickered and looked foolish, keeping time
to the music with the tapping of their feet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"You like to dance, I see," said Esther to one girl.</p>

<p>"You bet I do!"</p>

<p>The girl's jaws kept time to the music as she vigorously
chewed gum.</p>

<p>"Come, Jim," said another loud-voiced cowlass,
"that's our set."</p>

<p>And away they went, hand in hand, edging their way
through the crowded rooms. Soon they were in the
midst of the boisterous dancers.</p>

<p>Kenneth joined the human fringe around the dance
room. He stood watching as though what he saw
amused him.</p>

<p>"Swing y'r pardners," shouted the fiddler, above the
din of voices. Down came the bow across the strings,
that responded in shrill, piercing notes. Around flew
the dancers, their cheeks growing redder and redder.
The clatter of the cowboys' spurs, and the tapping of
the fiddler's foot kept time to the music.</p>

<p>While watching the dancers, Kenneth discovered
Jessie Roth, a young Scotch girl, in from the range. As
soon as he could do so, he presented her to Esther
Bright. Jessie responded to the introduction awkwardly
and shyly; but as she looked into Esther's face,
she seemed to gain confidence. It was such a kindly,
such a sympathetic face.</p>

<p>Jessie was a girl Esther had long been wishing to
meet, and to interest in better things. She was at heart
good, and if wisely directed would undoubtedly exercise
a wholesome influence over other girls. As the
teacher expressed her interest in her, and what they
might do together, Jessie's face beamed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hastings telt me aboot y'r Bible school, an'
how ye wantit me tae come. Did ye?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I did."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dae ye want mony mair tae come?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as many as you can bring, Jessie."</p>

<p>Then the two took seats in the corner of the room,
and Esther gave her an enthusiastic account of her plans
for the Gila girls. The Scotch girl listened, with an
occasional comment.</p>

<p>"Do you like the life on the range, Jessie?"</p>

<p>"Rael weel! Y're as free as the air!"</p>

<p>Here the girl gave her body and arms a swing, as
though ready to leap to the back of a running horse.
She seemed all muscle.</p>

<p>"My mustang's the best friend I hev. I broke 'er
mysel'. My! She can gae like the wind!"</p>

<p>"You!" said the astonished teacher. "Can you
break a horse?"</p>

<p>"Can I?" she repeated in amusement. "I'd like
tae show ye. I wad like tae tak ye oot on the range
wi' me. My, but ye'd like it!"</p>

<p>"No doubt. What do you do out on the range?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we rides an' rides an' looks after the cattle;
we cooks, an' plays cards, an' joshes the boys."</p>

<p>Here Jessie laughed.</p>

<p>"What a dreary life this must be," thought Esther.
She said aloud, "You must find the life monotonous and lonely."</p>

<p>"Never lonely, schoolma'am. It's full o' excitement.
There's somethin' doin' all the time. Sometime ye sees
herds o' antelope, or ye meets a grizzly. It's better'n
a dance tae bring down a grizzly."</p>

<p>"A bear?" the teacher exclaimed in astonishment.
"You don't mean to say you ever killed a bear?"</p>

<p>The cowlass's eyes sparkled as she said proudly:</p>

<p>"I've shot several, an' other big game too. But the
greatest thing on the range is tae see a stampede o'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
cattle. It's as much as y'r life's worth tae be in their
way."</p>

<p>The girl, though rough, had a vitality and picturesqueness
attractive to the polished New Englander.</p>

<p>It was equally certain that Esther was attractive to
the cowlass. Jessie left her for a moment, but soon
returned, bringing three others with her. After presenting
them, she said:</p>

<p>"Tell 'em, schoolma'am, what ye telt me."</p>

<p>"Tell what, Jessie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, aboot the Bible school an' the parties, an' how
ye wants tae dae somethin' fer the lasses."</p>

<p>Then Esther briefly outlined her plans, during which
they occasionally interrupted her by questions or comments.</p>

<p>"Do you mean, schoolma'am, that y're willin' to learn
us outside o' school hours?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Y're mighty good. I love ye already," said one
lass.</p>

<p>"But we're sae auld," said Jessie.</p>

<p>"No, you're not. You're not old,&mdash;not too old to
study."</p>

<p>"Yes, schoolma'am, that's what mother used tae say,"
said Jessie in a softer tone. She turned her face aside.
Another girl whispered to Esther, "Her father killed her mother when he was drunk."</p>

<p>Esther slipped her arm around Jessie's waist, and
continued to speak her plans, and how much their co-operation
would mean to her.</p>

<p>"Git y'r pardners!" shouted the fiddler.</p>

<p>Soon the lasses were led away to the dance; and for
the time, nothing more was said of their plans; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Esther Bright knew that of all the days' work she had
done in Gila, this would probably count the most.</p>

<p>The rooms were now crowded with people. The huge
candles burned lower; the air grew more stifling; the
noise more tiring.</p>

<p>As she looked up, she met the gaze of a young English
girl, who flushed and turned her eyes away. An instant
later, Kenneth Hastings seated himself by Esther and
began speaking.</p>

<p>"I was glad to see you talking with the cowlasses, for
they need the gentle, refining influence that you can
bring them." He was evidently deeply in earnest.
"You have no idea how full of peril their life is. You
see there is something in this bold, free life of exposure
that almost unsexes a woman. Some of the cowlasses
are good-hearted, honest girls, but many are a hard lot.
Your womanly influence would help them."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he caught sight of the girl who, a moment
before, had attracted Esther's attention.</p>

<p>"Do you see that girl with the cameo-like face?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I have been hoping you could save that child. She
can't be more than seventeen, if she is that. What her
previous history is I do not know; but it is evident
she has had gentle breeding."</p>

<p>"What a sweet face she has!"</p>

<p>"Yes. Lovely, isn't it? Like a flower."</p>

<p>"What is her name?" Esther looked sympathetically
at the girlish figure.</p>

<p>"Earle&mdash;Carla Earle. She lives at Keith's. I see
her often with Mark Clifton, a young Englishman here.
He is a wild fellow. She is shy of everyone else."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor child!" said Esther, glancing toward her.</p>

<p>"I made bold to speak to her one day, and invited her
to come to your Bible school. I believe if you could
meet her you would be her salvation."</p>

<p>Esther looked up with a grave question in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You invite her to come to the Bible school, but do
not come yourself, do not offer to help."</p>

<p>"It does seem inconsistent, doesn't it? I will try to
explain."</p>

<p>He studied the cracks in the floor.</p>

<p>"You see, I have felt that I would be a hypocrite if I
came. I know nothing about religion; at least, I knew
nothing about it until I began to find it in you."</p>

<p>"And yet religion is the great question of life. I
wonder that, with your habit of thought, you have not
been attracted to the study of philosophy and religion."</p>

<p>"Some of the most materialistic men I have known,"
he replied, "have been students of philosophy and religion.
They seemed anything but religious. But your
religion is practical. You live it. You make men believe
in your religion, make them believe it is the one
real thing of life. I need to be taught of you."</p>

<p>"Please bring this young girl to me, or take me to
her," she responded.</p>

<p>Together they sought Carla Earle. As Esther was introduced,
she clasped Carla's hand, and began to talk to
her of England. Kenneth excused himself, and the two
girls took seats in the corner where he had left them.
At first Carla avoided looking into the face of her companion.
When she did gain courage to look up, she
saw that Esther's face was full of tenderness. What
could it mean? Sympathy for her? Carla Earle?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Her chest rose and fell. Suddenly she hid her face in
her hands, while suppressed sobs shook her frame.</p>

<p>Quickly, Esther slipped her arm about her, and drew
her to the open door, and out into the clear night air.
There, Nature seemed full of peace. Up and down, the
two walked in the moonlight, talking in low, earnest
tones. Often they paused and looked up into the
heavens. Once the English girl bowed her head on the
New England girl's shoulder, and wept bitterly. The
teacher listened, listened to a story whose pathos
touched her heart. Then she said gently:</p>

<p>"You know right from wrong. Leave the wrong
life. Come to me for shelter, until I can find a home
for you where you will be safe, and I hope, contented."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't," sobbed Carla, "I am so unhappy!"</p>

<p>"I know you can leave if you will," Esther said
firmly. "You will have strength and courage given you
to do right. It is wrong for you to continue in the
life you are now living."</p>

<p>Carla shuddered. She was still weeping.</p>

<p>"God will never forgive me," she said. "He has
forsaken me."</p>

<p>She seemed utterly hopeless.</p>

<p>"God always forgives those who come to Him penitent,
Carla. He has not forsaken you; you have forsaken
Him. I am glad you and I have found each
other. Perhaps I can help you find your way back to
God."</p>

<p>Carla gripped her hand. When they re-entered the
house, the English girl slipped into the bedroom.</p>

<p>"Fust couple forrerd an' back!" called out the
fiddler, keeping time with his foot.</p>

<p>There were bows, differing more in quality than in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
kind; bows masculine, with spurred foot to rearward;
bows feminine, quite indescribable.</p>

<p>"Swing y'r pardners!" shouted the fiddler, flourishing
his bow. Around flew the lasses, with skirts and
ribbons flying; down came the boots of the cowboys,
their spurs clanking time to the music. The room grew
more stifling.</p>

<p>Among the late-comers was a middle-aged woman, immaculately
clean. Her snapping black eyes were set
close to her nose, which was sharp and thin. Her lips
closed firmly. Her thin black hair, drawn tightly back,
was fastened in a tight wad at the back of her head.
She wore an antiquated black alpaca dress, sans buttons,
sans collar, sans cuffs; but the crowning glory of her
costume, and her particular pride, was a breastpin of
hair grapes. She was accompanied by an easy-going,
stubby little Irishman, and a freckle-faced, tow-headed
lad of ten.</p>

<p>"Maw, Maw!" said the child, "there's my teacher!"</p>

<p>"Mind y'r mannerses," said the woman, as she cuffed
him on the ear.</p>

<p>"I am mindin' my mannerses," he said sulkily.</p>

<p>The teacher saw the shadow on the child's face,
stepped forward to greet him, then extended her hand
to the mother, saying:</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mrs. Black. I am Brigham's
teacher."</p>

<p>But Mrs. Murphy was on the warpath.</p>

<p>"I'm not Miz. Black," she snapped, assuming an air
of offended dignity; "I'm Miz Murphy, the wife o'
Patrick Murphy. This is my man," pointing to the
stubby Irishman, with the air of a tragedy queen. The
teacher thereupon shook hands with Patrick. Mrs.
Murphy continued:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"My first husband were a Young, my second a
Thompson, my third a Wigger, my fourth a Black, and
my fifth a Murphy."</p>

<p>"I wonders who the nixt wan will be," said Patrick,
grinning from ear to ear. "My woman lived wid the
Mormons."</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy's eyes looked daggers. He continued:</p>

<p>"An' she thought if it were good fur wan man to
marry many women, it were equally good fur wan
woman ter have many husbands, even if she didn't
have all of thim ter onct." He chuckled.</p>

<p>"Mind y'r bizness!" snapped the irate Mrs. Murphy.</p>

<p>"An' so it came my turrhn, schoolma'am, an' she
were that delighted wid me she have niver tried another
man since. Eh, mavourneen?"</p>

<p>Saying which, Patrick made his escape, shaking with
laughter.</p>

<p>Then Esther poured oil on the troubled waters,
by telling Mrs. Murphy how interested she was in what
Brigham had told her of his little sisters, Nora and
Kathleen.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down, Mrs. Murphy?"</p>

<p>Esther's voice and manner were very charming at
that moment, as she drew a chair forward for her companion.</p>

<p>Somewhat mollified, Mrs. Murphy seated herself.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind ef I do set down. I'm that tuckered
out with scrubbin' and washin' an' cookin', I'm
afeared I can't dance till mornin'."</p>

<p>As she talked, she fanned herself with her red cotton
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"You enjoy dancing, don't you, Mrs. Murphy?"
asked the teacher, with apparent interest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Enjoy dancin'? I should say I did!" She suddenly
assumed an air of great importance. "Back
East where I was riz, I went ter all the barn raisin's,
an' was accounted the best dancer in the county."</p>

<p>She showed sudden interest in the fiddler, and tapped
time to the music with her foot.</p>

<p>"Then I joined the Mormons. When I lived in
Utah, there was plenty o' dancin', I can tell you."</p>

<p>"You are from New York, Mrs. Murphy, I think you
said."</p>

<p>"Yep," complacently. "I was riz in York State,
near Syrycuse. My folks was way up, my folks was.
Why, my aunt's husband's sister's husband kep' a confectony,
an' lived on Lexity Street, York City. She
were rich, she were,&mdash;an' dressed! My landy! How
she dressed! Always latest style! Ye didn't know her,
I s'pose. Miz Josiah Common was her name, lived at
650 somethin' Lexity Street. Wisht you'd a knowed
her."</p>

<p>Here she mopped her face again.</p>

<p>It was not often that Mrs. Murphy found herself
in society, and in society where she wished to make an
impression. Her voice rose higher and shriller.</p>

<p>"Yep," she continued, in a tone of supreme satisfaction,
"I'm 'lated, as it were, to Miz Josiah Common.
She gimme this here pin."</p>

<p>Here she took off a hair grape pin, and held it up
for inspection. "A bunch o' grapes, yer see, hereditaried
in the family, descended from father to son, yer
know, in memory of the departed."</p>

<p>All this in a tone of one who gives information, and
commiserates the ignorance of the listener. Suddenly
Esther Bright lifted her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>

<p>"Got pink eye?" asked Mrs. Murphy with sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
sympathy. But at this moment Patrick Murphy joined
them, and Mrs. Murphy rose to dance with him.</p>

<p>As the two left her, Esther saw John Clayton edging
his way through the crowd. An instant later, he presented
Lord Kelwin, of Dublin, Ireland.</p>

<p>"Really," said the newcomer, "I had no idea I
should meet an American lady on the frontier. I am
charmed. So delighted, Mr. Clayton, to meet Mrs. Clayton
and Miss Bright. I had anticipated meeting Indians,
Indian princesses, don't you know, like the people
we see in the shows you send us."</p>

<p>"It is too bad you should be disappointed, Lord
Kelwin," said the New Englander, smiling. "There
are princesses galore in the southwest, and a little
search will reward you."</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, I did not intend to give the impression
that I was disappointed; rather, I am surprised
that here out of civilization, ah&mdash;ah&mdash;I should find a
lady,&mdash;<i>two</i> ladies. I count myself most fortunate."</p>

<p>John Clayton's eyes twinkled. At the first opportunity
he drew Lord Kelwin aside, and whispered in
his ear. The Irishman looked astonished.</p>

<p>"An Indian princess, did you say? By Jove!"</p>

<p>"Yes, of the blood royal," replied John Clayton, with
gravity.</p>

<p>"And possessed of untold wealth? What was it you
said?"</p>

<p>"Of untold wealth. I'd rather have her wealth than
the crown jewels of any royal house."</p>

<p>"By George! A fortune and a pretty girl thrown
in!"</p>

<p>It was evident that this bit of information was not
without effect upon Lord Kelwin, for he turned to Esther
Bright effusively.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is such a pleasure, such a great pleasure, to meet
one who so charmingly represents her race."</p>

<p>He bowed deferentially.</p>

<p>Esther looked mystified. Before she could frame a
reply, their conversation was interrupted.</p>

<p>Lord Kelwin drew John Clayton aside.</p>

<p>"An American princess, did you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, by divine right," responded the older man.</p>

<p>The Irishman adjusted his monocle, to view Esther
more critically.</p>

<p>"She looks more like an English woman," he said
meditatively. "Rather too slender to be a beauty."</p>

<p>"She was born on the free soil of America," continued
his companion, "and has some ideas of her own."</p>

<p>The Irishman smiled cynically.</p>

<p>"As if a pretty girl ever had ideas of her own! She
usually knows just what her mamma or governess
teaches her. I always find a pretty girl an easy victim.
I've broken more than one innocent's heart." He
twirled his moustache.</p>

<p>"You'll not get on so well with Miss Bright. You
see, she is used to meeting <i>men</i>." John Clayton looked
a trifle wicked, as he continued, "She might take you
for a long-headed animal with long ears."</p>

<p>But the last remark was lost upon the Irishman,
whose attention was fixed upon Esther Bright.</p>

<p>"You say her ancestors were savages, Mr. Clayton?"</p>

<p>"I suppose they <i>were</i> savages, same as ours. She
has the best heritage the ages can give,&mdash;a healthy body,
a beautiful mind, and a heroic soul."</p>

<p>John Clayton's voice, half ironical, had an undertone
of seriousness.</p>

<p>"A heroic soul! A heroic soul!" The Irishman
raised his monocle again. "I didn't suppose savages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
had souls. I've always imagined this fad about souls
came with civilization."</p>

<p>"I have begun to think," answered his companion,
"that with much of the so-called civilization, men and
women are losing their souls. Miss Bright is a remarkable
woman. She believes in the possibilities of
every man and woman. It is her purpose in life to
awaken the soul wherever she finds it dormant or
atrophied."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>Again the monocle was raised, and the Irishman's
curious gaze was fixed upon the American girl, then
engaged in conversation with a cowboy.</p>

<p>Patrick Murphy now interrupted this dialogue.</p>

<p>"Lord Kelwin, we wants yez ter dance an Irish jig."</p>

<p>The lord lifted his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"There's no one to dance an Irish jig with me unless
you do it yourself, Patrick."</p>

<p>Here there was a general laugh.</p>

<p>"Come along wid yez," persisted Patrick, half carrying
him toward the dance room.</p>

<p>"Here," he said to Lord Kelwin, "here's light-footed
Janette O'Neil will dance this wid yez."</p>

<p>There was a stir. The center of the room was
cleared, then out stepped Lord Kelwin, leading rosy,
graceful Janette. She was lithe and dainty.</p>

<p>The fiddler flourished his bow, drew it across the
strings, and brought forth the strains of "Soldier's
Joy,"&mdash;a melody that sets an Irishman's feet flying.</p>

<p>Janette's short, red skirt showed her trim feet and
ankles. Down the room came the two dancers, side by
side, their feet fairly flying. Backward, again they
danced, the length of the room, still keeping up the
feathery rapidity of flying feet. Then Lord Kelwin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
swung his partner around and around; then facing each
other, they danced apart. Expressions of admiring
approval were heard.</p>

<p>"Them's fine dancers!"</p>

<p>"Go it, Kelwin! I'll bet on you."</p>

<p>"Three cheers for ould Ireland!"</p>

<p>Down again the full length of the room sped the flying
feet; then back again. Then, whirling as birds in
flight, they faced each other once more, and danced
apart, and finished the dance amid deafening applause.
As it continued, Lord Kelwin raised his hand for attention.</p>

<p>"Give us the Highland fling. Here, Burns, you and
Jessie Roth dance the Highland fling."</p>

<p>"Highland fling! Highland fling!" echoed many
voices.</p>

<p>Again the center of the room was cleared, and Robert
Burns led forth Jessie Roth.</p>

<p>In a moment the air of "Bonnie Woods and Braes"
shrieked from the fiddle. With rhythmic swing of body
and limb, the graceful Scotch dancers kept time to the
music. Up rose the arm of the girl, with inimitable
grace; forward came one foot, daintily touching the
floor. It was the very poetry of motion. At the close
of this dance, the applause was again deafening.</p>

<p>"Git y'r pardners fer Virginny reel!" shouted the
weary fiddler.</p>

<p>In the rush of the dancers, John Clayton was
jostled against Esther Bright and Kenneth Hastings.</p>

<p>"Well!" said he, "I believe we'd better go out to
supper, and then start homeward."</p>

<p>A brief search brought the other members of the
party. They seated themselves at a long improvised
table, covered with red tablecloths. There was but one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
course, and that included everything from roast venison
and Irish stew, hot biscuit and honey, to New England
doughnuts, hot tamales and whiskey.</p>

<p>Near by sat an Indian half-breed, who, discovering a
large plate of doughnuts, greedily devoured every one.
As he had been drinking heavily, no one interfered, or
made audible comments. When the Clayton party were
about to withdraw, there were sounds of scuffling, oaths
and cries, from the adjoining room, followed by a heavy
thud. Some one had fallen. John Clayton rushed out,
and finding one of his own cowboys in the fight,
dragged him out into the open air. To keep him out of
the mêlée, he sent him for their team, and he himself
returned to the house for the members of his party.
The leave-taking over, the spirited team dashed away
from Jamison Ranch. The lights of the house grew
fainter and fainter, then disappeared. The babble of
voices, the clink of glasses, the clatter of spurs, the
sound of dancing feet, were far behind. To the New
England girl, the experience of the night seemed a
strange dream; and the reality, the solemn hush of the
midnight sky brooding over all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>A SOUL'S AWAKENING</h3>

<p class="cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> next evening, as the Claytons gathered
about the fire, heavy footsteps were heard
on the veranda.</p>

<p>"The cowboys are just in from the
range," explained the host.</p>

<p>The door opened, and four cowboys entered.
Abashed at the presence of a stranger, they responded
awkwardly to the introduction. They were a picturesque
group in the flickering firelight. All were dressed
in corduroy jackets, belted with heavy leather belts,
each of which held a gun and a sharp knife. Each
man wore leather trousers, fringed at the bottom, high
boots, with clanking spurs, and sombrero hats that no
one deigned to remove on entering the room. They
were brawny specimens of human kind, with faces copper-colored
from exposure.</p>

<p>The Claytons welcomed them to a place before the
fire. Many a curious glance wandered toward Esther.
She listened intently to their tales of hair-breadth
escapes, of breaking bronchos, of stampedes of cattle, of
brandings and round-ups, of encounters with Indians
and wolves, and of perilous feats of mountain climbing.
Noticing her interest, their tongues were loosened, and
many a half-truth took on the color of whole truth.</p>

<p>One of the cowboys had been so absorbed in watching
her that he had taken no part in the conversation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
His steady, persistent gaze finally attracted her attention.
She was perplexed as to where she could have
seen him. His face looked strangely familiar to her.
Then it came to her in a flash that it was at the schoolhouse
the day of the organization of the Bible school.
He was one of the men who had protected her. She
saw he could not be measured at a glance.</p>

<p>His face, though strikingly handsome, was one men
feared. Yet there were those who could tell of his deeds
of gentleness and mercy. These were in his better moments,
for he had better moments.</p>

<p>Many tales were told of his courage and daring. Mr.
Clayton sometimes expressed the belief that if this cowboy
had been reared in the right kind of atmosphere,
he would have achieved distinction. His eagle eye and
powerful jaw indicated a forceful personality.</p>

<p>As Esther felt his magnetic gaze, she turned and
asked:</p>

<p>"Were you not at the schoolhouse the day we organized
the Bible school?"</p>

<p>"I was there a few minutes," he responded. But he
did not add that he had gone away with the ruffians
to prevent their disturbing her.</p>

<p>She expressed the wish that he would visit the Bible
school.</p>

<p>"Oh, I haven't been in a church since I was a kid,"
he blurted out. "Then my stepfather turned me out
ter earn my livin'. I'm now twenty-eight, an' I don't
know nothin' but cattle, an' bears, an' wolves an' Indians."</p>

<p>"It is sad not to have a home, isn't it?" she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know 'bout it's bein' sad," he answered,
as though embarrassed. There was a change of expression
in his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
"But then your being thrown upon your own
resources has made you brave, and self-reliant, and
strong."</p>

<p>He squared his shoulders.</p>

<p>"In some ways, you have had great opportunities,
Mr. Harding,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't call me 'Mr. Harding,'" he interrupted,
"Call me 'Jack.'"</p>

<p>"I'll try to remember." Her face lighted. "These
opportunities have given you magnificent physical
strength. I know people who would give a fortune just
to have your superb strength."</p>

<p>He straightened up.</p>

<p>"Well, I'd be glad to give it to 'em, if I could only
have a chance to know somethin'."</p>

<p>"Know what?"</p>

<p>"Know how a man ought ter live." There was in
his voice a deep, vibrant undertone of earnestness.</p>

<p>"It's a great thing to live, isn't it?" She spoke as
though pondering some vital question. Jack Harding
watched her curiously.</p>

<p>"Some jest half live, schoolma'am."</p>

<p>"That is probably true," she responded, "but God
created us capable of something better. He has given
us His world to know, and the people in it."</p>

<p>"The people in it," he repeated contemptuously.
"Some people are a bad lot, schoolma'am, an' I'm one
of 'em."</p>

<p>"You must not speak so of yourself. A man who
will protect a woman, in order that she may continue
her work unmolested, is not a bad lot. Now I should call
you a pretty <i>good</i> sort of a man." A luminous smile.
Almost any man would have become her willing slave
for that smile.</p>

<p>As her voice gave special emphasis to the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
"good," he squared his shoulders again. She continued:</p>

<p>"A man doesn't know how good he really is until he
begins to try to help some one else up. Then he finds
out."</p>

<p>"I need to be helped," he said, in a tone that seemed
to be intended for her ear alone. "I am ignorant,&mdash;don't
know nothin'. Can't hardly read, or write, or
cipher. Could yer learn me?"</p>

<p>She looked at the strong man before her, touched by
his appeal.</p>

<p>"What do you wish to learn?"</p>

<p>"First readin' an' writin' an' cipherin'."</p>

<p>"What next?"</p>

<p>"Oh, everythin', I guess."</p>

<p>The others had caught fragments of the conversation,
and now joined in. Mike Maloney spoke first.</p>

<p>"Do yez think yez are a kid again, Jack, that yez
are sthartin' wid book learnin'?"</p>

<p>"No, Mike, not a kid, but a dunce."</p>

<p>Before the teacher could protest, he continued:</p>

<p>"Ye'll find me an ignoramus, schoolma'am. A fellow
out on the range, or in a minin' camp, don't git
much schoolin'. But sometimes when ye're alone under
the open sky, an' the stars come out, there's somethin'
in here" (striking himself on the chest) "that is&mdash;is&mdash;unsatisfied.
I want somethin'. I don't know what it
is I want, but I believe you can help me find out."</p>

<p>Let those scoff who will; there is such a thing as divine
unrest; and when this takes possession of a man,
his evolution has begun.</p>

<p>John Harding went on with increasing earnestness.</p>

<p>"Yer see, schoolma'am, this not knowin' is awful.
Y're not all a man should measure up to. Y're in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
prison like, hide bound. It's come ter me ter-night, all
ter onct, that an ignoramus is in bondage, an' that only
education can set him free."</p>

<p>The tide of his feeling gave him a rough eloquence.
It was evident his words found a responsive echo in the
other cowboys' hearts.</p>

<p>The teacher had listened with deepening interest.
John Harding had set her a task,&mdash;the greatest task, nay,
the greatest pleasure man or woman can know, of leading
a human soul out of bondage into freedom.</p>

<p>One of the cowboys, Jimmie Smith by name, nudged
Mike Maloney, and whispered:</p>

<p>"Ask her to learn us, too."</p>

<p>Mike readily assented.</p>

<p>"Would yez be willin' ter bother wid us too?"</p>

<p>"It would be no bother. I'd be glad to help you."</p>

<p>There was no doubting her sincerity.</p>

<p>In a few moments, the men were seated around the
dining table, each with pencil and paper, and a lesson
in penmanship had begun.</p>

<p>"Gosh!" said Jimmie. "Ef that don't look like the
rail fences back in Indianny!"</p>

<p>As he said this, he held up to view the very best he
could do after repeated efforts. He laughed uproariously
at himself, the others joining from pure sympathy,
for Jimmie's laugh was contagious.</p>

<p>But Mike worked as though entered for a race. He
seemed to need an astonishing amount of the teacher's
attention, especially after she commended his work.</p>

<p>"Schoolma'am," he called out, beckoning to her with
his dirty hand, "would yez be showin' me the nixt?"</p>

<p>She bent over him, naming principles, explaining
slant and spacing, as she made a group of letters.</p>

<p>"Stim letthers, did yez say? Stim? Stim?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>He held up his work and looked at it critically.
"Manin' no disrespict to yez, schoolma'am, I'll jist
call 'em, not stim letthers, but fince posts."</p>

<p>After the laughs and gibes had ceased, he listened to
her a moment, and then remarked, "The stims should all be sthandin' the same way,
did yez say?"</p>

<p>He grinned as he viewed his writing o'er. It was
clear to him, even at that early stage of the work, that he
was not cut out for an expert penman. Yet his last effort
that evening he seemed to regard with special pride
and satisfaction, and this is what the teacher found on
his paper when she returned to observe his work:</p>

<p>Night after night, these cowboys gathered for an hour
or more at the Clayton home for study with Esther
Bright. Reading, and arithmetic, and talks on physical
geography followed. The cowboys did not suspect it,
but she was fighting the degrading influences of the
saloon.</p>

<p>Days came and went. The interest in the night
school increased; so did the interest in the Bible school.
But for some indefinable reason, John Harding had not
visited it.</p>

<p>One Saturday morning, when Esther sought the
schoolhouse to do some work there, he joined her, entered
the building, and built a fire for her. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
observing the decorations of the room, he saw on the
walls the words, "God so loved the world, that he gave
his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him
should not perish, but have everlasting life."</p>

<p>He read and reread the words. What could it
mean? He was ashamed to ask. At last his great dark
eyes sought the teacher's face. She saw a question in
them.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"What does what mean?"</p>

<p>"Them words,&mdash;'God so loved the world', an' so on."</p>

<p>"What don't you understand?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand none of it. Yer see, us fellers
uses 'God' as a cuss-word. That's all I know 'bout
God."</p>

<p>"Have you never read in the Bible about Jesus?"</p>

<p>"Bible? I ain't seen one sence I was a kid, 'n' I
never read it then, 'n' ef God is a father 'n' anythin'
like my stepfather, I reckon I don't care ter make his
acquaintance."</p>

<p>"He is not like your stepfather, for Jesus never
turns anyone away. He invites people to come to Him.
Would you like to hear about this, John?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mum."</p>

<p>"Well, sit down and I'll tell you."</p>

<p>So they sat down near the desk. Then the woman
of twenty-four told the Christ-story to the man of
twenty-eight as to a little child. He listened intently,
with the eagerness of a man in whom the passion to know
has just been born. The teacher's words thrilled her
listener. She pictured Jesus a child. Jesus a young
man in Nazareth, working among his fellows, tempted,
victorious; Jesus healing the sick and afflicted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
mingling with sinful men, and freeing them from their
bondage to sin. The expression of the man's face was
indescribable. As she reached the story of the Crucifixion,
he asked huskily:</p>

<p>"Why did God let the Jews kill him?"</p>

<p>"Many have asked that question. All we know about
it is what the Bible tells us. I used to wonder if there
could not have been some other way of salvation than
through the suffering and death of Jesus."</p>

<p>Her look was far away, as of one thinking of things
eternal. Again she read aloud:</p>

<p>"And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto
them, 'The Son of Man shall be betrayed into the hands
of men, and they shall kill him, and the third day he
shall be raised again.' And they were exceeding
sorry."</p>

<p>"He knew it, then, that they would kill him?"</p>

<p>"It seems so." She read on:</p>

<p>"He taught his disciples and said unto them, 'The
Son of Man is delivered into the hands of men, and
they shall kill him; and after that he is killed, he shall
rise the third day.'"</p>

<p>She turned the leaves and read again: "'As Moses
lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must
the Son of Man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth on
him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God
so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but
have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the
world to condemn the world, but that the world through
Him might be saved.'"</p>

<p>"He died for us?"</p>

<p>She nodded, and continued: "'I tell you the truth;
it is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
away the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I
depart, I will send him unto you.'"</p>

<p>"The Comforter!"</p>

<p>"Listen, John. 'Greater love hath no man than this,
that a man lay down his life for his friends.'"</p>

<p>Then she closed the book.</p>

<p>"Greater love hath no man than this," he repeated.
She took up the words, "'that a man lay down his life
for his friends.'"</p>

<p>"He&mdash;gave&mdash;his&mdash;life&mdash;for&mdash;us!"</p>

<p>John Harding spoke slowly. The great truth that
has comforted the human heart for ages had at last
reached his dormant soul. The eagle eye seemed looking
inward; the iron jaw set; the strong hand clinched.
In this deep inward look, the man seemed to have forgotten
the presence of the teacher. At last into the
hard face flashed a comprehending light, and he spoke.</p>

<p>"I would give my life for you."</p>

<p>"I believe you would," she said, never doubting.
"Just so Jesus gave his life for all mankind."</p>

<p>He looked up.</p>

<p>"I begin to understand."</p>

<p>"He taught men how to live," explained the teacher.
"He taught that great and worthy love means sacrifice,
and that all who would truly love and serve their
fellow men must cease to think about self, and must
get about doing kind, helpful things for other people."</p>

<p>"I have never known the meaning of love or sacrifice,"
he said. "I don't know no more about them things
than I do about God. But tell me about Jesus. What
happened after they had crucified him?"</p>

<p>He listened with intense interest as she told the story.</p>

<p>"I want ter know more," he said. "I never knowed
sech things was in the Bible. Ef I'd knowed it when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
I was a kid, I'd a lived a differ'nt life. I s'pose it's
too late now."</p>

<p>"No; not too late." Her voice was low and gentle.</p>

<p>"I don't know how ter begin," he said helplessly.
"Tell me how."</p>

<p>"One way is to feel deeply sorry for anything wrong
in one's past; to repent of wrong thoughts, wrong words,
wrong deeds."</p>

<p>"But, schoolma'am, my wrong deeds has been so
many," and he bowed his head on his arms on the desk
before him.</p>

<p>"Not so many&mdash;" her voice was comforting&mdash;"but
God will forgive them, if you are truly sorry. Pray
every day, pray many times a day, that God will not
only forgive you, but help you become a better man."</p>

<p>He raised his head.</p>

<p>"I don't know how ter pray. I'm afraid ter pray.
Do you know," he said desperately, "I've committed
about every crime but murder?"</p>

<p>Again he bowed his head on his arms. His frame
shook with sobs. The calm, well-poised girl had never
before seen such a stirring of the deeps. A strong
man in tears is not an easy thing to witness.</p>

<p>"Will yer pray fur me?" he said at length; but he
did not lift his head.</p>

<p>Then upon his ears fell the comforting voice of the
teacher. It was the first time in all his life anyone
had prayed for him. Something choked him. At last
he looked up into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Learn me ter pray," he said huskily.</p>

<p>"Say this, John, <i>now</i>: 'Jesus, Son of God, have
mercy on me.'"</p>

<p>He repeated, "'Jesus, Son of God, have mercy on
me!'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the first prayer John Harding had ever prayed.
He rose to go.</p>

<p>"I wisht&mdash;." He hesitated.</p>

<p>"What do you wish?"</p>

<p>She reached out a delicate, expressive hand, and
laid it gently on his brawny arm. It came to him, at
that hour, like a benediction from God.</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> do you wish?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"I wisht you'd give me a Bible."</p>

<p>She lifted the Bible from her desk, one long used by
her and carefully marked, and placing it in his open
hand, she said:</p>

<p>"Never forget, John, that Jesus, the Christ, the Son
of God, has bought your soul with a great price, and that
it belongs to God."</p>

<p>He tried to thank her. Then turning, without a vocal
word of thanks, he left the room; and with long, easy,
rapid strides, sought the solitude of the mountains.</p>

<p>The something within him that had long been beating
to be free, now asserted itself. It <i>would</i> have way. It
seemed to be his real self, and yet a new man, risen up
out of his dead and fruitless past. It seemed to sing
within him, yet it sorrowed. And in the midst of the
sorrow, a great hope was born. He knew it now,&mdash;this
Something was his own Soul!</p>

<p>There, on the heights of the rugged foothills, he
stood alone. Only the fathomless deeps of the sky saw
the struggle of that human soul. For a while he seemed
to be passing through the tortures of the damned. He
fought his way inch by inch. Great beads of sweat
covered his forehead; then, lifting one clenched hand
high in the air, as though he had burst forth from a dungeon
of death into the light of day, he said:</p>

<p>"God! God!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE GILA CLUB</h3>

<p class="cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> class of cowboys soon outgrew the living
room at Clayton Ranch, and now occupied
the schoolhouse three consecutive evenings a
week. Although the class had organized as
the Gila Club, for study and social life, the
meetings thus far had been for the purpose of study
only.</p>

<p>From the inception of the club, it had met with popular
favor. For many a day, nothing had been so much
talked of, and talked of with such unqualified approval.
The knowledge of the teacher, her unselfish interest in
the men, her goodness and kindness, were themes upon
which many a rough man grew eloquent. Had Esther
Bright been a Sister of Mercy, in the sacred garb of
the Church, she could hardly have been revered more
than she was. It never occurred to her as she went and
came among them, that she needed a protector. Before
the year was over, many a one in that group would have
risked his life to save hers.</p>

<p>And yet, Esther Bright was not such an unusual
woman. Such as she may be found almost anywhere
in this land, sanctifying the home; rearing children
to be true men and women; teaching in the schools;
ministering to the sick; protecting the pure; rescuing
the fallen; and exemplifying in every act of their lives,
Christ's teachings of love and mercy. And the work
of this great sisterhood goes quietly, unfalteringly on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
making, as no other force does, for the real progress of
the race.</p>

<p>An Esther Bright is never written up in glaring headlines
of yellow journalism; an Esther Bright is never
offered in barter for a foreign title and a degenerate
husband; such as she are never seen at the gaming table,
nor among the cigarette and cocktail devotees. We
find her in places where the world's needs are great,
calm, well-poised, intelligent, capable, sympathetic; the
greatest moral force of the age.</p>

<p>The common man, if decent, always respects such
a woman. She becomes to him a saint, an ideal; and
in proportion to his respect for her, is his own moral
uplift possible.</p>

<p>So those rough men of Gila, in those days of long ago,
came to look upon Esther Bright as a sort of saint,
their Angel, as they called her; and with this deepening
respect for her, there gradually grew up in them, faint
at first, but sure at last, a wholesome respect for all
womankind. Such was the atmosphere of the Gila
Club.</p>

<p>Among the first to attend the meetings, after the
organization of the club, was Patrick Murphy, whom
Esther had not seen since the night of the ball. He
came with John Harding, and as he entered the room,
he took his pipe from his mouth, jerked his slouch hat
from his head, and gave a queer little duck in lieu of
a bow.</p>

<p>"I am plazed to be wid yez, Miss." He smiled
broadly.</p>

<p>She assured him of a cordial welcome from all, extending
her hand as she spoke. He gripped it till she
winced, and became so engrossed in hearing himself
talk that he forgot to release it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"The byes has been tellin' av me as yez learn 'em
ter git on. Now that's what Oi allus preach,&mdash;git on.
There's no use allus bein' wid yer nose ter the grindstone."</p>

<p>He released her hand to stuff more tobacco in his
pipe. After a puff or two, he continued his remarks:</p>

<p>"The childthren has been gittin' on so well, Oi sez
to mesilf, sez Oi, p'raps the schoolma'am can learn
me ter figger, an' read an' write. So here Oi am,"
(slapping his chest heartily, as that portion of his anatomy
rose an inch higher) "here Oi am!"</p>

<p>Just then Esther's attention was sought by a group
of newcomers. Kenneth watched her attitude towards
the people. She was gracious and cordial, but there
was about her a fine reserve that the commonest man
felt, and tacitly respected.</p>

<p>At first, this young Englishman had been attracted
to the young New England girl by the delicate loveliness
of her face, and the elegance of her manner. He
had felt, from the first, that in his social intercourse with
her, he must rise above the empty platitudes of society.
There were times when he flattered himself he had made
progress in her favor. Then, when he presumed upon
this, he was met by a strong wall of reserve.</p>

<p>Here she was now, bestowing smiles and gracious
words upon just common men. He was filled with
disgust. Then he, gentleman as he was, man of the
world, university graduate, engineer, felt his self-love
wounded; and he thereupon had an acute attack of
sulks.</p>

<p>What was she to him, anyway?</p>

<p>The stern patrician face looked coldly, cynically on at
the men around him. The "vulgar herd," he called them.</p>

<p>Just in the midst of his morbid reflections, he heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
a merry, contagious laugh from Esther. He did not
glance up. But, in an instant, she was at his side,
telling with great glee the skit that had provoked the
laughter. It was so irresistibly funny, Kenneth laughed
with them, and the ice was broken.</p>

<p>To be sure, he did not know Esther Bright as he
did the alphabet, but what of that? Who could sound
the deeps of such a rare woman's soul? She <i>was</i> a rare
woman. He conceded that every time he held an argument
with himself, when she was the question of the
argument. Always in her life, he was sure, there would
be a reserve, through which no one could pass, unless it
might be the ordained of God. She fascinated him
more and more. One moment, in his adoration, he
could have humbled himself to the dust to win one
gracious word from her; at other times, his pride made
him as silent and immovable as a sphinx.</p>

<p>On this particular night at the club, Kenneth was
in one of his moods. If Esther saw, she did not betray
it. She came to him, telling in a straightforward
way, that the work had grown so she could not do it
all herself, and do justice to the men? Would he help
her? There was a class in arithmetic. Would he
kindly teach that for her to-night? Kenneth looked
savage.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say no," she urged appealingly. "They
are working in compound numbers and are doing so
well. <i>Won't</i> you take the class?" she urged, again.
And Kenneth consented.</p>

<p>It is but justice to say that the selection of the
teacher proved wise. What this did for Kenneth himself
is not the least part of the good resulting therefrom.</p>

<p>Soon the click of pencils, and occasional questions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
answers indicated that the arithmetic classes were at
work. In one corner, the dignified and scholarly John
Clayton sat helping a young miner learn to write. By
her desk, sat Esther Bright, teaching Patrick Murphy
to read.</p>

<p>Learning to read when a man is forty-five is no easy
task. Patrick Murphy did not find it so. He found
it rather humiliating, but his unfailing good humor
helped him out.</p>

<p>The teacher began with script sentences, using objects
to develop these. She wrote the sentences on the blackboard.
Again and again the sentences were erased and
then rewritten. But the pupil at last remembered.</p>

<p>One sentence was, "I am a man." Patrick hesitated;
then solemnly said, as though reading:</p>

<p>"Oi certainly am not a woman, manin' no disrespict
to women folk, Miss."</p>

<p>She read quietly from the blackboard again, "I am a
man."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Miss, it would be more intilligint fur me
ter say, 'Oi am an Oirishman.'"</p>

<p>"Very well," she said, smiling, "I will write the sentence
that way."</p>

<p>"You see, Miss," he continued, with droll seriousness,
"it is ividint Oi am a man. Let me read the sintinces
agin!" And he read them correctly.</p>

<p>Here the classes changed, each teacher helping a group
of men with a simple reading lesson. Then followed the
lesson in penmanship, taught by Esther Bright, and the
work of the evening was over.</p>

<p>As the three teachers left the schoolhouse door, Mr.
Clayton laid his hand on Kenneth's shoulder, and said:</p>

<p>"Come over to see Mrs. Clayton a little while. It's
still early."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>Kenneth hesitated.</p>

<p>"Yes, do," urged Esther. "We have some plans to
work out for the club, you know, and we need your
help."</p>

<p>Again there was an appeal in her voice. What
a brute he had been! What a fool! So he strolled
along with the two. As they stepped on the veranda,
they heard a deep voice.</p>

<p>"Lord Kelwin!" exclaimed John Clayton.</p>

<p>The greetings over, the meeting of the club and its
possibilities became the subject of discussion.</p>

<p>"Why can't you join us, Lord Kelwin?" questioned
the host.</p>

<p>"Yes, why not?" said Esther, with sudden animation.</p>

<p>Kenneth Hastings' face darkened.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;I&mdash;well&mdash;" stammered Lord Kelwin. "I
didn't suppose my services&mdash;ah&mdash;would&mdash;ah&mdash;would be
agreeable to the <i>teacher</i>,"&mdash;and he looked first at Esther
Bright, and then at Kenneth Hastings.</p>

<p>A single, hectic flush suddenly appeared in one of
Esther's cheeks. Then Mr. Clayton spoke.</p>

<p>"You do not seem to understand, Lord Kelwin, that
Miss Bright's class has grown so rapidly she has had to
have assistance, and Mr. Hastings and I, for lack of better
material, have been pressed into service. Come,
yourself, and you'll want to help the good work on."
Lord Kelwin raised his monocle.</p>

<p>Esther spoke quickly, with more enthusiasm than
usual.</p>

<p>"The girls have been seeking the same opportunity
we are giving the men. They need help just as much,
and so we must plan to help them too!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and kill yourself!" growled Kenneth Hastings.</p>

<p>John Clayton smiled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not if Miss Bright has sufficient help. If she will
organize the work, we can surely assist her."</p>

<p>For a time, it seemed as though a club for girls was
doomed. Then Mrs. Clayton came to Esther's rescue.</p>

<p>"Miss Bright is already in touch with the girls, and
knows something of their great need."</p>

<p>"But they're such a tough lot," rejoined Lord
Kelwin.</p>

<p>"Then they need her influence all the more. She can
help them if anyone in the world can." Again Mrs.
Clayton had helped her out. The hectic flush deepened.
Esther's eyes grew brilliant. Her voice, when
she spoke, was low, calm, sweet, but vibrating with an
earnestness the group about her had occasionally heard
in her voice before. She spoke with decision:</p>

<p>"I shall help the girls!"</p>

<p>"That settles it!" responded Kenneth, half in admiration,
half in disgust. He could not understand
what it was that could make a girl of her fine and sensitive
nature, a girl of her beauty and culture and great
attainments, not only willing, but eager, to help a group
of coarse, uncouth men and women, of doubtful reputation,
and who, to his mind, were utterly incapable of
appreciating her.</p>

<p>John Clayton spoke again.</p>

<p>"Won't you join us, Lord Kelwin?"</p>

<p>Again the Irishman looked at the teacher, but her
eyes were fixed on the glowing fire.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;well&mdash;I suppose&mdash;I could."</p>

<p>"Suppose we have a joint meeting of the men and
women next Saturday evening," said Esther. "Have a
programme that would not be very long, but interesting.
Then let them have a social time, and treat them
to some cake and coffee."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is a happy thought, Miss Bright," said Mrs.
Clayton in hearty approval.</p>

<p>Now plans began to be discussed in earnest. And before
the guests departed, it had been decided that the
first social function ever given by the people of Gila
should be given in the schoolhouse the following Saturday
night.</p>

<p>As the two men walked toward the camp, Lord Kelwin
questioned his companion.</p>

<p>"What did Clayton mean by Miss Bright's being of
the 'blood royal'?"</p>

<p>"That is what he meant."</p>

<p>"Related to some royal house of Europe, some native
ruler here, eh?"</p>

<p>His companion stopped and laughed.</p>

<p>"Royal by nature. It is such blood as hers that
should flow in the veins of the rulers of the earth."</p>

<p>"Then she has no vast estates coming to her?"</p>

<p>The darkness concealed the contempt on Kenneth's
face.</p>

<p>"If there is a God, (and I begin to believe there is)
she has a rich reward before her."</p>

<p>"Poor in this world's goods, eh?"</p>

<p>"<i>Rich</i> as few women are."</p>

<p>His companion whistled. Kenneth stopped. Lord
Kelwin stopped too.</p>

<p>"Deuced fine girl, isn't she?" said the Irishman. His
companion made no reply. After another remark from
Lord Kelwin, Kenneth said sharply:</p>

<p>"I do not care to discuss Miss Bright."</p>

<p>So the conversation ended. But something rankled
in the heart of the Englishman.</p>

<p>Saturday night came. Such jollity! Such overflow
of spirits! The laughter was loud and frequent. People<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
came in a steady stream until the little schoolhouse
was full to overflowing.</p>

<p>Among the first arrivals, were Patrick Murphy and
his wife. He was beaming with good nature. But Mrs.
Murphy had come (as she expressed it) "agin her
jedgment." She viewed the company with a chilly
glance. Patrick chuckled.</p>

<p>"It's plazed Oi am wid this evint. Oi've persuaded
me woman, here, as this is quoite equal ter anythin' she
iver attinded in York State, not even barrin' a barrn
raisin'."</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy's beady black eyes seemed to come closer
together. Her mouth set. Her nose rose by gradual
gradations into the air, and her spinal column stiffened.
She delivered herself to the following effect:</p>

<p>"I <i>will</i> confess as I have never been at a club afore.
Back in York State they was only fur men folks. But
my 'lations as lives on Lexity Street, York City, knows
what clubs be, an' parties too, I reckon."</p>

<p>But here John Harding, the president of the club,
called the meeting to order. He announced that the
first number on the programme would be a talk on physics,
by Mr. Hastings.</p>

<p>After the applause, Patrick Murphy, in facetious
mood, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Begorra, if yez are not commincin' wid physic fur
our stomachs!"</p>

<p>"No," responded the speaker, "but physics for your
head, Patrick."</p>

<p>When the laugh at Patrick's expense had subsided,
Kenneth announced the subject of his talk as "Magnetism."
He talked simply, illustrating as he talked. Occasionally
he was interrupted by questions that showed
a fair degree of intelligence, and a desire to know. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the close of his talk Patrick, the irrepressible, burst forth
again:</p>

<p>"Yez said that a natural magnit could magnetize a
bar o' steel, makin' the steel a sthronger magnit than
the iron, an' yit this natural magnit be jist as magnitic
as it was before?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Begorra!" said Patrick, slapping his knee, "yez'll
have a harrd toime makin' me belave that. The idea!
that anythin' can give to another more nor it has itself,
an' at the same toime have as much lift itself as it had
before it gave away more nor it had!"</p>

<p>Patrick drew himself up. He had assumed a sudden
importance in the community. Did he not know?</p>

<p>The teacher smiled indulgently. As she spoke, there
was quiet, respectful attention.</p>

<p>"You see, Mr. Murphy, the natural magnet is like a
human being. The more strength a man puts forth, the
more he will have. If we give of ourselves, of our
talents, to help other people, we are enriched by it. So
the magnet teaches us a lesson, don't you see?"</p>

<p>Patrick scratched his head dubiously. The teacher
continued:</p>

<p>"A natural magnet may not have much power in itself,
but when it shares its power with a steel bar, the
bar can do vastly more than the piece of iron could. In
the same way, the influence we exert, though it may not
be great in itself, may enable other people to do greater
things than we could possibly do."</p>

<p>The lesson went home.</p>

<p>Patrick shook his head approvingly.</p>

<p>"All right, Miss, all right! Oi'll belave the sthory if
yez say so. Oi foind it hard to understhand what makes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
a bit o' iron a natural magnit. What Oi does understhand
is yez are loike the steel magnit, an' yez draws
the rist av us to yez!"</p>

<p>And having delivered himself of this compliment,
which apparently met with the hearty approval of the
company, he subsided.</p>

<p>Then John Harding announced the next number on
the programme,&mdash;a talk on Ireland by Lord Kelwin, illustrated
by Mr. Clayton with his magic lantern. Again
there was applause; and as the lights were put out, the
giggling and laughter grew boisterous. In an instant, a
picture flashed on the screen, and the laughter changed
to quiet attention.</p>

<p>Lord Kelwin's voice soon made itself heard. He was
well-known in camp, and popular. He spoke in a bright,
attractive way, with occasional flashes of Irish wit, when
he provoked laughter and comment again. On one of
these occasions, Patrick burst forth. Patrick was in
fine spirits. He had stopped at the saloon on the way
to the party.</p>

<p>"Begorra, the ould counthry is all foine enough in a
picture or lecture; but Oi loike the Imerald Oile on this
soide betther. The Imerald Oile of Ameriky, bounded
on the north, by the North Pole; on the east, by the Atlanthic;
on the south, by the South Pole; on the wist, by
the Pacific; an' on the top, by the rist o' the universe.
Hoorah fur the Imerald Oile of Ameriky!"</p>

<p>A howl went up, and a laugh from everyone, followed
by much clapping.</p>

<p>"Where did you learn so much geography?" asked
one. Again there was a laugh.</p>

<p>"And this," said the speaker, as a new picture flashed
before their eyes, "is Blarney Castle. Here is where
Patrick learned his blarney."</p>

<p>But Patrick was not to be outdone. He chuckled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"The blairney stone was all roight whin Oi was at
Blairney Castle in the ould counthry; but whin Oi
landed in Ameriky, Oi wint to Plymouth, an' there Oi
found an Oirish saint holdin' a rock. Oi sez ter him,
sez Oi, 'Phat do yez call the rock where the Pilgrims
landed'? An' he looks at me scornful loike, an' sez he
ter me, sez he, 'Y're mishthaken', sez he, 'this is the
blairney stone of Killairney. Ameriky imports all the
bist things from the ould counthry."</p>

<p>The people fairly howled.</p>

<p>"Includin' you, eh, Patrick?" shouted an Englishman,
above the uproar of laughter.</p>

<p>The address held everyone's attention, and at its close,
both Lord Kelwin and Mr. Clayton were loudly applauded.</p>

<p>"This closes our programme," said John Harding.
"We hope ye'll talk an' have a good time, an' look about
the room ter see what the children of the school have been
doin'. Then the women folks will feed yer cake an'
coffee."</p>

<p>This announcement, too, was applauded.</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy, belle of the back East barn raisings,
separated herself from the company. She came upon a
good-sized play house, neatly painted and papered. It
was furnished tastefully with little woven rugs, wire
furniture, and crocheted window curtains. Over different
articles, were placed the names of the children
who had made them. Mrs. Murphy stood in amazed admiration,
for her own children had been among the most
skilled workers. She found simple garments, neatly
made, and here and there bits of sewing, clumsy, and
botched in some cases, because baby fingers had been at
work.</p>

<p>The teacher joined Mrs. Murphy, who said to her:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't say, schoolma'am, as you learns the young
uns to do sich things as this?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Don't you like it?"</p>

<p>"Like it! I should say! Why, fust I know, they'll
be makin' their own cloes, an' their pap's an' mine!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>But in another part of the room, a different conversation
was going on.</p>

<p>"I tell ye," said Jessie Roth, who was talking to Bobbie
Burns, "schoolma'am kens an awfu' lot."</p>

<p>"How dae ye ken?" he asked with an air of scorn,
"ye dinna ken muckle yirsel'."</p>

<p>"Ye jist shut up, Bob Burns," she replied testily. "I
may not ken muckle, neither do ye. Ye has no manners.
I tell ye I want ter learn. I'm a mind ter quit the range
an' go ter school."</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Jessie?" asked the teacher, coming
up at this moment, and slipping her arm about the
girl's waist. "I believe Bob has been teasing you.
Make up, children;" and smiling kindly, and with a reassuring
grasp of Jessie's hand, she passed on.</p>

<p>"What'd I tell ye?" asked the girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's only a woman. Anyway, she don't care
much for you lasses, or she'd had a club for girls."</p>

<p>This was more than Jessie could stand.</p>

<p>"A woman, did ye say? A woman?" Jessie's eyes
flashed with anger. "An' wasna' y'r mither a woman,
Bob Burns?"</p>

<p>"I believe she was," answered the boy with a broad
grin. He was enjoying himself.</p>

<p>"An' as fur the schoolma'am's not carin' fur the girls,
y're mistaken. I'm sure she will have a club fur us."</p>

<p>"Yes," taunted the burly fellow, "to hammer things
into y'r heads with."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>At this Jessie left him in high dudgeon. She sought
Esther and asked:</p>

<p>"<i>Don't</i> ye like we girls as much as the boys?"</p>

<p>"Just a little bit better, perhaps. Why, Jessie?"</p>

<p>"Bob Burns says ye don't care fur the girls, an' he
knows ye don't 'cause ye hain't made no club fur
them."</p>

<p>"Bob's mistaken, isn't he? We girls," and the
teacher paused and smiled into several faces, "we girls
are to have a club soon. Don't you say so?"</p>

<p>The girls gathered about her. Bob's remark, repeated
by Jessie, had been most timely, and crystallized what
had been in the girls' minds,&mdash;to organize such a club
for women as had been organized for the men.</p>

<p>They talked rapidly, several at a time; but at last
they listened to Esther, as she asked them to visit the
school at an hour they could agree upon, on the following
Monday. This they promised to do. But at this
juncture, John Harding interrupted the conversation.</p>

<p>"They want ter know as will yer tell 'em a short story,
Miss Bright."</p>

<p>"A story? Let&mdash;me&mdash;see&mdash;! What shall I tell them,
Jack?"</p>

<p>"Tell 'em about Abraham Lincoln, as didn't have no
chance till he made it hisself."</p>

<p>So she told them a story of a hero, a plain, simple
man, a man of toil, a man of great heart. She pictured
his faithfulness to simple duties, his rise to the highest
position his countrymen could bestow upon him, his
death and the nation's sorrow.</p>

<p>As she finished, a cowboy asked, "Did yer say that Abraham Lincoln was onct president
of the United States?"</p>

<p>"Yes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"My!" he exclaimed, "I wisht I'd 'a knowed him!
I wisht I could 'a fit on his side!"</p>

<p>"It is not too late to fight on his side," she said.
"Every time you try to live a more sober, honest, decent
life, every time you try to be more manly and true, you
are fighting on the same side he did."</p>

<p>"Gosh!" he said. "I didn't know that. I thought
fightin' meant jest killin' off the other fellers."</p>

<p>While the refreshments were being served, John Harding
extended an invitation to the men to attend the club
regularly, and suggested that the girls see Miss Bright
about a club for girls, adding:</p>

<p>"I believe a club fer women is in the air."</p>

<p>Vociferous applause. Patrick Murphy stepped forward.</p>

<p>"John Harding, y'r honor, I jist wish ter say as this
is the foinest toime Oi've had in Ameriky; an' I tells
yez all this: that if any young feller wishes ter git on,
he will have a chance here in this club. Schoolma'am
learns us a lot (the Saints bliss her!). She's a foine
lady! She believes in givin' a man a chance ter be a
man. Instid o' wastin' our earnin's in the saloons Saturday
nights, let's come here t' the club, an' learn how
ter git on. Save y'r money, lads. Now who'll give
three cheers f'r Miss Bright?"</p>

<p>The room rang with the cheers.</p>

<p>The festivities were over, the last guest, gone. The
officers had taken their leave, and the Claytons walked
on ahead, leaving Kenneth Hastings to escort Esther
Bright home.</p>

<p>"It was a great success," he said enthusiastically.</p>

<p>When Esther spoke, there was an expression of weariness
in her voice.</p>

<p>"Tired?" he asked gently, with sudden sympathy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>She looked so slight, so fragile, to shoulder a man's
work in the world, he felt a sudden shame at the insignificance
of what he had done. He would stand between
her and the world, this he would do.</p>

<p>"You gave an instructive and interesting talk," she
was saying. He recalled his wandering thoughts.</p>

<p>After thanking her, he said he had liked Patrick's remarks
about her being a magnet.</p>

<p>"Patrick's great fun, isn't he?" she laughed.</p>

<p>"Yes, but he usually hits the right nail on the head.
It is true, as he said, you <i>do</i> draw people to you. You
draw me to you as no one has ever done."</p>

<p>"Don't!" she began.</p>

<p>"You have taught me to believe in true womanhood.
I used to despise women. I thought they were a vain,
frivolous lot, at the bottom of all the wrong-doing of the
world."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I understand that some Englishmen have
very little respect for woman; that she is regarded as
the inferior of man, a little higher in the scale of intelligence
than a horse or dog."</p>

<p>"How sarcastic we are to-night!" he said ironically.</p>

<p>"The Englishwoman trains her daughters to wait on
their father and brothers."</p>

<p>"How extensive has your acquaintance been with the
English?"</p>

<p>"Many American men grow up as their fathers have
done before them, chivalrous toward the women of their
families, and often chivalrous to women everywhere."</p>

<p>"Indeed! A paragon of animals, the American
man!"</p>

<p>"England kept her universities closed to women, because
English men were afraid bright English women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
would carry off scholastic honors, if admitted to the universities."</p>

<p>"What remarkable wisdom you possess in the matter!"</p>

<p>"I read the magazines."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"And the daily papers," she added, chuckling.</p>

<p>"Remarkable!"</p>

<p>"I read several English periodicals. I am interested
in English politics."</p>

<p>"The deuce!"</p>

<p>"The&mdash;what?" she asked, with a suggestion of suppressed
mirth in her voice.</p>

<p>"The gentleman with horns."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," she said. "I have heard something of the
gentleman. A very bad-tempered fellow, isn't he?
Have you known him long?"</p>

<p>"By George, you think you're funny, don't you?"
But by this time he laughed, too.</p>

<p>"Come in, Kenneth," called John Clayton, when they
reached the veranda.</p>

<p>"No, I thank you," said Kenneth. "Miss Bright has
been abusing men, and Englishmen in particular."</p>

<p>"Well," responded John Clayton laughingly, "you
stood up for our sex, I hope."</p>

<p>"I tried to, but Miss Bright came out ahead. Good night,
Miss Bright. I hope you'll change your opinion
of the Englishman, and that he will not always suffer
when compared with your pink of perfection, the American
man."</p>

<p>When he had gone a short distance, she called him
back.</p>

<p>"Well?" he said, turning.</p>

<p>"I just wished to remind you that it isn't becoming
to you to be grouchy."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"You wretch!" And he turned on his heel and
stalked away.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Kenneth?" asked John
Clayton.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Esther, indifferently, "he thinks altogether
too much of Mr. Kenneth Hastings. He must
learn there are other people in the world besides K.H."</p>

<p>"Don't be too hard on him," said her host warningly.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I won't. I'll teach him to respect
the human being, irrespective of sex, color or previous
condition of servitude. Good night."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE COW LASSES</h3>

<p class="cap">I<span class="smcap">t</span> was clear that the character of the work for the
Gila girls should differ from that for the men.
Esther Bright had thought it all out, but she resolved
to let the girls themselves determine, in
large measure, what it should be. So they came
to visit the school that bright December day to observe.</p>

<p>School! Could this be school? Not school as they
recalled it, hours of dull monotonous tasks, where punishment,
merited or unmerited, stood out in conspicuous
boldness. As they now listened, every moment seemed
to open the door to knowledge, and a wonderland of surprising
interest spread before them. The dull drone of
the old-time reading lesson had given place to conversational
tones. The children were reading aloud from a
bright, vivacious story that caught and held the attention
of these untutored girls. To learn to read like the
teacher became the proud ambition of these seven
visitors.</p>

<p>With a simple lesson in physics the interest deepened.
Then came the lesson in manual training. The deft
fingers of the boys and girls were busy learning the mysteries
of tailoring. How to darn a rent in cloth is no
easy thing for untrained fingers to learn. Little fingers,
big fingers, busily plied the needle. The boys were
learning how to repair their clothing. The teacher
passed from one to another, helping, encouraging, commending.
She held up a beautiful piece of work for the
visitors to see.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>When the school was dismissed for the noon hour,
they gathered around Esther.</p>

<p>"My!" said one, "I wisht I knowed as much as you
do, schoolma'am."</p>

<p>"Do you?" asked the teacher, as if to know as much
as she did were the easiest thing in the world.</p>

<p>"You bet I do!" answered the girl.</p>

<p>"Schoolma'am," asked Jessie Roth, "do ye s'pose ye
could learn us tae read as good as them kids did this
mornin'?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Even better."</p>

<p>"Better nor them?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes, if you will study as hard as they do.
One's progress depends upon one's interest and one's
application."</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll study all right," said Kate Keith, "if
you'll give us the chance."</p>

<p>"You bet we will!" said another.</p>

<p>Then Esther told them the history of the Gila Club
for men, how it had begun, how she had taught the men,
how the class had grown until it had seemed imperative
to meet in the schoolhouse, and how they organized
as a club.</p>

<p>"Did <i>you</i> learn all them men yourself?" asked a girl
just in from the range. She was a veritable Amazon.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the answer, "until we began to meet in
the schoolhouse. Then I had help."</p>

<p>Esther stood looking into this raw girl's face as though
she saw there the loveliest being on earth. What the
teacher really saw there was an awakening mind and
soul.</p>

<p>The girl, rough and uncouth as she was, admired the
teacher, and longed to be like her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"What can we dae?" asked Jessie Roth, eager to perfect
plans for study.</p>

<p>"That is just what I wish you girls to decide. What
would you like to do?"</p>

<p>In response to the teacher's question, all of them spoke
at once.</p>

<p>"One at a time, please, one at a time," Esther said.
"Suppose, we commence with Jessie. What do you wish
to do, Jessie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd like tae dae cipherin' an' readin' an' writin'.
I wisht I could read like you, schoolma'am!"</p>

<p>"Could she ever?" questioned Kate Keith, a young
English girl.</p>

<p>"Certainly." She showed such belief in them and
what they might do that their enthusiasm rose still
higher. Then Kate said impulsively:</p>

<p>"I wisht ye'd learn us to sew. I've been wishin' to
know how."</p>

<p>She held up her big, coarse hands, looked at them a
moment, and laughed as she said:</p>

<p>"I don't know as I could handle such a little thing
as a needle."</p>

<p>"You wish to learn to sew? I am so glad."</p>

<p>This was just the turn Esther had been hoping would
come. "Every woman," she continued, "ought to know
how to sew. I like to sew, myself. What next?"</p>

<p>A comely maid spoke. "My name's Mandy Young.
Me an' Marthy thought we'd like ter learn ter write
letters an'&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here she blushed furiously.</p>

<p>"That's good," said the teacher. "What else?"</p>

<p>"Me an' Marthy wanted ter learn ter sing like you do,
schoolma'am."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, Martha, it is your turn," said the teacher
with an encouraging smile.</p>

<p>Martha was a great, brawny specimen of humankind.
"My name's Miss Lieben," she said.</p>

<p>"Lieben! Lieben! That's a good name. It means
<i>love</i>." The cowlass blushed and snickered. "And
Martha's a good name too. There was once a very careful
housekeeper named Martha."</p>

<p>"Oh, I ain't no housekeeper," responded the girl,
"but I want ter be. I want ter learn readin' an' writin',
an' cookin', too."</p>

<p>"Cooking! Well! Next?" said Esther, looking into
the face of the next girl.</p>

<p>"My name's Mary Burns."</p>

<p>Mary had a more modest way. "I hardly know what
I dae want. I think ye could plan for us better nor
we could plan for oursels. An' we'd a' be gratefu'."</p>

<p>"Sure," said one.</p>

<p>"That's right," added another. They all nodded
their heads in approval. Then up spoke Bridget Flinn:</p>

<p>"Shure, an' she's on the right thrack. When we
can do housework, we can command a high wage, an'
git on. My cousin gits five dollars a week in New York,
an' she says she has mere nothin' ter do, an' dthresses
as good as her misthress. Oi'd loike ter learn ter write
letthers, so as ter wroite ter Pat, an' Oi'd loike ter learn
housekapin', so's I could go out ter sarvice."</p>

<p>Then a pretty Mexican girl, with a soft voice, spoke:</p>

<p>"Martha Castello is my name. I want to learn to
read an' write an' sing."</p>

<p>The teacher stepped to the blackboard, and wrote the
following:</p>

<div >
<table class="left" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td class="td4">Reading</td>
    <td class="td4">Arithmetic</td>
    <td class="td4">Sewing</td>
</tr>
<tr><td class="td4">Writing</td>
    <td class="td4">Singing</td>
    <td class="td4">Housekeeping</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>The girls watched her intently.</p>

<p>"An' letthers," suggested Bridget.</p>

<p>"To be sure&mdash;letters," said Esther, writing the word.</p>

<p>Then followed the organization of the girls' club,
resulting in the election of Jessie Roth as president. It
was agreed that for the present the girls should enter
school, and occasionally meet with the teacher outside
of school hours.</p>

<p>That day proved a red-letter day for them. They
had come in touch with an inspiring personality, and
their education had begun.</p>

<p>Years have come and gone since that day; but the
people of Gila still tell how a young girl, the sweetest
soul that ever lived, came and dwelt among them, and
brought God into their lives. Even the roughest old
men will pause, and say with reverence:</p>

<p>"The Angel of the Gila! God bless her!"</p>

<p>The afternoon session of the school passed quickly.
Then followed a bit of kindly talk with the seven new
pupils. Then Esther Bright walked homeward. She
was overtaken by Brigham Murphy and Wathemah.
Something mysterious seemed in the air.</p>

<p>"Miss Bright," blurted out Brigham, "Maw says as
will yer come home with us ter-morrer, ter visit. We're
goin' ter have chicken an' lots o' good things ter eat,
ain't we, Wathemah? An' he's comin', too, ain't yer,
Wathemah?"</p>

<p>The Indian child gave an affirmative grunt, and
trudged along close to his teacher. It was a way he had
of doing since she had promised to be his mother.</p>

<p>"Will yer come?" eagerly questioned the representative
of the Mormon household.</p>

<p>"I shall be happy to if you will show me the way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
"Oh, we'll 'scort yer!" And Brigham turned several
somersaults, and ran like a deer along the road
leading to the Murphy ranch.</p>

<p>Such a flutter of excitement as the prospective visit
brought to the Murphy household!</p>

<p>"Maw," said Brigham in the midst of his mother's
volley of directions on household arrangements, "Ain't
yer goin' ter ask schoolma'am ter stay all night?" He
seemed suddenly interested in social amenities.</p>

<p>"Of course I be! Landy! Don't yer s'pose y'r
maw's got no p'liteness? I told schoolma'am 'bout my
'lations as lives on Lexity Street, York City, an' keeps
a confectony, an' she'll 'spect yer ter be jest as p'lite
an' 'ristercratic as they be. I'll sleep on the floor, an'
Kate an' Kathleen an' Wathemah kin sleep with schoolma'am.
She'll think it a great come-down, Pat Murphy,
fur one as is a 'lation, so ter speak, of Miz Common of
Lexity Street, York City, she'll think it's a great come-down,
I say, fur one with sech folks ter live in a common
adobe. Y'r not ter let on y're Irish, but speak as
though yer was French like."</p>

<p>She had given emphasis to her remarks with more
and more energetic movements of her arm, as she washed
off the furniture. At last she paused, and her husband
ventured a reply.</p>

<p>"Begorra! An' would yez be afther changin' me
mouth to the Frinch stoile?"</p>

<p>He sidled toward the door, and grinned as he caught
the reflection of himself in the dirty piece of mirror
that still remained in the old black frame on the wall.</p>

<p>There was no denying the fact that Patrick bore
unmistakable evidence of his Irish origin. He realized
that he had ventured his remarks as far as was consistent
with peace and safety; so he walked from the
house, chuckling to himself as he went,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> "Relations on Lexington Street! Frinch stoile!
Begorra!" And he laughed outright.</p>

<p>"Patrick Murphy," his spouse called after him.
"This is the first time a friend o' my 'lations in York
City (so ter speak) has visited me. Patrick Murphy,
what <i>do</i> yer s'pose Josiah Common done when my sister
visited there? He took her ter a theatre an' after that
he took her ter a resternt, an' treated her. That's what
he done! The least yer can do is ter scrub up, comb
yer har an' put on a clean shirt ter-morrer. Yer ter
clean up, do yer hear?" All this in a high treble.</p>

<p>"Frinch stoile?" inquired Patrick, with a broadening
grin. But this was lost upon Mrs. Murphy, engrossed
in plans for the reception of the coming guest.
She smoothed down her hair with both hands.</p>

<p>"Here, Mandy," she called abruptly, "wash out
the tablecloth. Sam, you clean the winders. Jo,
you run over to Miz Brown's an' say as y'r Maw's
goin' ter have comp'ny ter-morrer as must have knowed
her 'lations as lived on Lexity Street, York City, an'
kep' a confectony. Tell her y'r Maw wants a dozen
eggs ter make a cake an' custard. Jake, oh, Jake!" she
called in stentorian tones, "you go ketch them two settin'
hens! The only way yer kin break up a settin'
hen when yer don't want her ter set is jest to make
potpie o' her. Y're goin' ter have a supper that yer'll
remember ter y'r dyin' day. We uster have sech suppers
at barn raisin's back East."</p>

<p>The small boys smacked their lips in anticipation.
The mother turned suddenly.</p>

<p>"My landy!" she said. "I forgot somethin'."</p>

<p>"What?" inquired Amanda.</p>

<p>"A napting!"</p>

<p>"A napting? What's that?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>But Mrs. Murphy had begun on the floor, and was
scrubbing so vigorously she did not hear the question.</p>

<p>When order finally evolved from chaos, Mrs. Murphy,
with her hair disheveled and arms akimbo, viewed
the scene. Everything was so clean it was sleek,&mdash;sleek
enough to ride down hill on and never miss snow or
ice.</p>

<p>"Come 'ere, childern," said Mrs. Murphy, mopping
her face with a corner of her apron. "I want yer to
stan' aroun' the room, the hull ten o' yer, all but the
baby. Mandy, do take the baby an' stop her cryin'.
Joseph Smith, stan' at the head, 'cause y're the oldest.
That's the way I uster stan' at the head o' the spellin'
class when we uster spell down 'fore I graduated from
deestrict school back in York State. Y'r Maw was a
good speller, ef I do say it. 'Range y'rselfs in order,
'cordin' to age."</p>

<p>A tumultuous scramble followed. Maternal cuffs,
freely administered, brought a semblance of order.</p>

<p>"Now, childern," said the mother, in a hard shrill
voice, "what is y'r 'ligion? Speak up, or yer know
what yer'll git!"</p>

<p>"'Ligion o' the Latter Day Saints," answered
Samuel.</p>

<p>"An' who is the Prophet o' the Lord?" continued
Mrs. Murphy.</p>

<p>"Brigham Young," answered Amanda, assuming an
air of conscious superiority.</p>

<p>"No, he isn't neither," protested Brigham, "for
my teacher said so. Jesus is the only prophet o' the
Lord since Old Testament times."</p>

<p>But the heretic was jerked from the line, to await later
muscular arguments. Then the mother continued her
catechism.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who's another prophet o' the Lord as has had
relevations?"</p>

<p>"Joseph Smith," responded Kate, timidly.</p>

<p>"That's right. What divine truth did Joseph Smith
teach?"</p>

<p>"That men should marry lots o' wives," said Jake,
realizing that he had answered the most important
question of the catechism.</p>

<p>"Yes, childern," she said, with an air of great complacence,
"I've obeyed the prophet o' the Lord. I've had
five husbands, an' I've raised ten young uns. Now what
I want yer to understan' is that yer Maw an' her childern
has got all the 'ligion as they wants. Schoolma'am
had better not persume to talk 'ligion to me." She
drew herself up as straight as a ramrod, and her lips
set firmly.</p>

<p>"But I wanter show her I'm uster entertainin'. I'll
give her the silver spoon. An' I do wisht I had a napting
to put at her place."</p>

<p>"What's that, Maw?" asked Samuel.</p>

<p>"What's what?"</p>

<p>"Why, what yer want ter put at schoolma'am's
plate?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a little towel, like. 'Ristercratic people uses
them when they eats. They puts 'em on their laps."</p>

<p>"Won't a dish towel do?"</p>

<p>"Landy! No!"</p>

<p>"Well, we ain't stylish, anyway," said Samuel, philosophically,
"an' it's no use to worry."</p>

<p>"Stylish? We're stylish when we wants to be, an'
this is one o' them times."</p>

<p>"Is it stylish ter go ter Bible school?" asked Brigham.
He seemed greatly puzzled.</p>

<p>"No, sir-ee, it ain't stylish, an' you ain't goin' thar,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
she said, giving him a cuff on the ear by way of emphasis.</p>

<p>"She? What's she know 'bout <i>my</i> 'ligion or <i>y'r</i>
'ligion? She ain't had no relevations. But git off to
bed, the hull lot o' yer."</p>

<p>"It's only eight o'clock," said one, sullenly, dragging
his feet.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't care. The house is all red up, an'
I wants it to stay red up till schoolma'am comes. Besides,
y're all clean yerselfs now, an' yer won't have to
wash an' comb to-morrer."</p>

<p>At last they were driven off to bed, and gradually
they quieted down, and all were asleep in the little
adobe house.</p>

<p>But Brigham tossed in terrifying dreams. The scene
shifted. He was with Wathemah, who was telling him
of Jesus. Then the teacher's life was in danger and he
tried to save her. He felt her hand upon his head; a
smile flitted across his face, his muscles relaxed; he was
in heaven; the streets were like sunset skies. The teacher
took him by the hand and led him to the loveliest Being
he had ever beheld, who gathered him in His arms, and
said, "Suffer little children to come unto Me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE VISIT AT MURPHY RANCH</h3>

<p class="cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> hour hand of the clock was on three.
Twenty pairs of restless eyes watched the
minute hand as it drew close, very close to
twelve. The books had been placed in the
desks; there was a hush of attention. The
children sang "America," saluted the flag, and marched
out of the room. As Wathemah returned to visit with
his teacher, she asked him what he had learned that
day.</p>

<p>"Country love!" answered the child. As he spoke,
he stepped to the flag, that hung from the staff in graceful
folds, and caressed it.</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Bright, Miss Bright!" shouted James
Burns. "Brigham's come fur yer! He's brung his
horse fur yer ter ride! Golly! But he looks fine!
Come see!"</p>

<p>And James led the way to Brigham and the horse.
Sure enough! There they were. The little lad, radiant
with pride, the huge bay horse, lean and gaunt and
hairy, bedight as never was horse before. He seemed
conscious that this was a gala day, and that it behooved
him to deport himself as became a respectable family
horse.</p>

<p>Numerous small bouquets, tied to white muslin strings,
adorned his bridle. The animal was guiltless of saddle,
but there was an improvised cinch of white cotton cloth
around him. This, likewise, was adorned with butterfly-like
bouquets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ain't he some?" said one lad, admiringly.</p>

<p>"Gee! but I'd like ter ride him!" shouted another.</p>

<p>"Brigham dressed old Jim up just 'cause yer wuz
goin' ter ride him, Miss Bright," said Donald.</p>

<p>To the last remark, the teacher replied:</p>

<p>"Ride him? I never rode bareback in my life. I
am afraid to try it. I might slip off."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, yer won't," said Brigham, who stood holding
the horse's bridle. The teacher pretended to be
greatly scared. The company grew hilarious.</p>

<p>"Brigham," she said, "I am sure I can't stick on.
I might go sliding over the horse's head and land in a
heap. Then what would you do?"</p>

<p>"Pick yer up."</p>

<p>This reply increased the hilarity.</p>

<p>Donald seemed to think it would be great sport to see
the teacher's maiden effort at riding bareback.</p>

<p>"Jest git on, Miss Bright, an' see how easy 'tis,"
he urged.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to mount," she hastened to say.
"I haven't learned even that much."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's easy enough," said a muscular little
chap. "I'll show yer."</p>

<p>And he leaped like a squirrel to the horse's back.</p>

<p>"Oh, I could never do that," said Esther, joining
in the laughter of the children.</p>

<p>"I'll tell yer what," said a large Scotch boy, "ye
wait a bit, Miss Bright, an' I'll bring ye y'r chair, an'
then 'twill be easy enough."</p>

<p>So the chair was brought, and the teacher seated herself
on the horse's back, sideways.</p>

<p>"Oh, ye must ride straddles," insisted Donald, "or
ye'll sure fall off."</p>

<p>"Yes, straddles," echoed another; but Esther shook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
her head dubiously, and pointed to her full blue flannel
walking skirt.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," said the tallest boy, "everybody
rides straddles here."</p>

<p>"Try it," urged Brigham.</p>

<p>So she tried it. But she was not the only passenger
who rode astride. Michael and Patrick, the little
Murphy twins, were helped to a place behind her.
Wathemah then climbed up in front of her.</p>

<p>"Is this all?" she asked, laughingly.</p>

<p>"I should think it was enough," said Kenneth Hastings,
who at that moment joined the company.</p>

<p>As he caught Esther's eye, both laughed, and the
children joined from pure sympathy.</p>

<p>When she recovered her composure, Esther said to
Kenneth, "Nothing lacking but some white muslin harness and
posies on me."</p>

<p>At last, amid shouts and cheers, the much-bedecked
horse and his human load started up the mountain
road.</p>

<p>By three o'clock, the pulse of the Murphy household
beat faster. The temperature rose to fever heat.
Three-fifteen, three-thirty; still no visitors; and what
is more, no signs of visitors. Every five minutes, one
of the children would run down the mountain road, and
return disappointed.</p>

<p>"Do yer s'pose they ain't comin'?" queried Kate,
who had been kept at home that day to assist in the
preparations.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they're comin', I think likely," answered
the hostess; "but I don't see where they're keepin'
theirselves."</p>

<p>She frequently straightened the chairs; once more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
she dusted the furniture with her clean apron; she
straightened the pictures on the walls; she brought out
an old and much-prized album, sacred to Mormon
prophets and elders. The broken mirror, that adorned
the wall, had been cleaned and decorated with tissue
paper. Mrs. Murphy stood and looked in it. She saw
reflected a sharp, severe face shining like the mirror.</p>

<p>"I wisht I had a collar," she said. "I uster wear
a collar back in York State."</p>

<p>Suddenly, she heard a shout from the road.</p>

<p>"They're comin'! They're comin'! Schoolma'am's
with 'em! Quick, Maw, quick!"</p>

<p>There was a rush down the path, Joseph Smith leading
the line.</p>

<p>All was expectation. The approaching horse started
into a jolting trot. As he neared the barn he began
to buck. The inevitable followed. Over the horse's
head went the passengers in a heap. The twins quickly
extricated themselves, and sprang up uninjured; but
the two visitors lay unconscious.</p>

<p>"Quick, Samuel, bring water!" directed Mrs. Murphy.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, she dashed water in the unconscious
faces, and watched anxiously. The water soon restored
Esther, who had been stunned by the fall. At last
Wathemah opened his eyes, and saw his teacher kneeling
by his side. He tried to rise, but fell back with a
cry of pain. One arm lay limp by his side. It was
evident that his arm was broken.</p>

<p>"Is there a surgeon anywhere near Gila?" she asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>"There's one about fifteen miles away," responded
Joseph.</p>

<p>"Then I'll try to set Wathemah's arm myself. Several
times I have helped my uncle set broken bones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Could you bring me some flat splints about this size?"
she asked, showing Joseph what she wanted.</p>

<p>"Yes, mum," answered the boy, starting on his errand.</p>

<p>"And some strips of muslin, and some pins, Mrs.
Murphy?" she continued.</p>

<p>In a few moments the articles were ready. By this
time Wathemah had recovered consciousness.</p>

<p>"You have broken your arm, dear," she said. "I am
going to set it. It'll hurt you, but I want you to be
brave and keep very still."</p>

<p>The child smiled faintly. But as she lifted his arm,
he again fainted. They lifted him, and carried him into
the house. Then firmly, deftly, as though experienced
in such work, Esther pulled and pressed the broken
bone into place. The child roused with the pain, but
did not cry out again. At last the arm was bandaged,
and placed on a cushion.</p>

<p>"You must be very careful of your arm, Wathemah,"
she said, patting his cheek, "until the broken bone
grows together."</p>

<p>Before the child could speak, there was a knock at
the door. The children rushed to open it, and there
stood Kenneth Hastings.</p>

<p>"I came to see if the cavalcade reached here safely,"
he said, smiling. "I followed a short distance behind
you, until&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here his comprehending glance grasped the situation.</p>

<p>"Wathemah hurt?" he asked in quick sympathy,
striding to the child's side. "I feared something might
happen."</p>

<p>"Old Jim threw 'em," explained three or four eager
voices.</p>

<p>Kenneth looked inquiringly at Esther.</p>

<p>"Were you hurt, too?" he asked in a low voice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think not," she said, looking intently at Wathemah.</p>

<p>"I believe you <i>were</i>. Was she?" he asked, turning
to Mrs. Murphy.</p>

<p>"She were stunned like from the fall, but was so
busy settin' the boy's arm, she didn't think of herself."</p>

<p>"Ah." Then turning to Esther again, he questioned
her.</p>

<p>The family observed every tone in the questions and
answers.</p>

<p>During the setting of the arm, they had watched
Esther with open-mouthed astonishment.</p>

<p>"I tell yer, schoolma'am," remarked Joseph, "I bet
yer life yer'll hev all yer kin do in Gila, now."</p>

<p>"I should think she already had enough to do," suggested
Kenneth.</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Murphy, suddenly realizing that certain
amenities had been omitted, blurted out:</p>

<p>"This is my son, Joseph Young; my daughter, Mandy
Young you've knowed already; my son Samuel Young,
my son Jacob Black, yer've knowed at school, 'n' my
daughter Kate Black, 'n' Brigham Murphy, aged six,
'n' Kathleen, aged four, 'n' Nora, aged two."</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy paused. Samuel at once took the floor.</p>

<p>"We've knowed <i>you</i> ever sence you come. They call
you the angel o' the Gila." He seemed to swell with
importance.</p>

<p>"A queer name, isn't it?" said Esther.</p>

<p>Samuel had combed his hair, and wore a clean shirt
in honor of the occasion.</p>

<p>"Miss Bright," said Kenneth, "I am fearful lest
you <i>have</i> been injured by the fall. Let me take you
home."</p>

<p>This she would not listen to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then let me call for you later in the evening and
take you back with me. There may be something Mrs.
Clayton can do for you." But there was a chorus of
protests.</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy gave it as her opinion that the schoolma'am
knew her own feelin's best; and it wasn't often
they had comp'ny, goodness knows, especially comp'ny
from back East. And Mr. Hastings should leave
her be.</p>

<p>Esther poured oil on the troubled waters; and Mrs.
Murphy became so mollified she pressed Kenneth to
stay to supper.</p>

<p>At this juncture Patrick Senior's step was heard.</p>

<p>"Good avenin'," he said, heartily, making a queer
little bow. "It's proud I am ter welcome yez ter me
home."</p>

<p>He did not take off his hat nor remove the pipe from
his mouth. Esther rose.</p>

<p>"Kape y'r sate, Miss, kape y'r sate," he said, making
a sweeping gesture. Then he gripped her hand.</p>

<p>"An' Mr. Hastings! It's honored Oi am ter have
yez enter me humble home."</p>

<p>"He's goin' to stay to supper, Pop," said one of the
little boys.</p>

<p>Kenneth hastened to excuse himself, but Patrick
would have none of it. Mr. Hastings must stay, and
share the fatted calf.</p>

<p>Kenneth laughed.</p>

<p>"Which is the prodigal?" asked he, smiling towards
Esther.</p>

<p>"The prodigal? the prodigal?" repeated Mrs. Murphy
mystified, and half resentful at Kenneth's smiles.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's a Bible story, Mrs. Murphy," explained
Esther. "A rich man had two sons. One son spent all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
he had in riotous living. When he finally repented and
came back home to his father's house, they were very
happy to see him and made a great feast for him. For
this purpose they killed their fatted calf."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mrs. Murphy with great dignity. "An'
sence we are happy to see yer and have killed our fatted
hens fur yer, we'll just call yer the Prodigal."</p>

<p>"I always knew you were prodigal of your strength
and talent," Kenneth said merrily. "Prodigal. That's
a good name for you. That was a happy thought of
yours, Mrs. Murphy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy still looked mystified.</p>

<p>"Oi see me little girrls are plazed ter see yez," said
Patrick, beaming proudly upon the little ones. Kathleen
held up for his inspection some paper dolls Esther
had brought her. Then the smile on his face broadened.
He laid his pipe on the shelf and examined the
dolls critically.</p>

<p>"Did yez iver see the loike on it, now? Shure, an'
did yez say 'Thank yez' ter the lady?"</p>

<p>"Yep," answered Kathleen, and "Yep," echoed Nora.</p>

<p>"An' phwat is the matther wid Wathemah?" asked
Patrick, as he approached the little Indian.</p>

<p>"Got hurted."</p>

<p>"Broked his arm."</p>

<p>"Fell off old Jim."</p>

<p>"Miss Bright mended his arm," came in quick succession.</p>

<p>"Poor little lad. Oi'm sorry yez got hurted."</p>

<p>And the kind-hearted man patted the child on the
head. He liked Wathemah. But the little visitor was
intent on the two little girls and their gay paper dolls.</p>

<p>Esther now expressed a wish to hear some of her
host's stories of pioneer life in Arizona.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>Patrick drew himself up. He felt his self-respect
rising.</p>

<p>"Them wuz awful toimes," he said, puffing away
at his pipe again; "but Oi wuz young an' sthrong.
The Apaches wuz on the warpath most av the toime,
an' we fellers didn't know but we'd be kilt ony minute.
We slipt wid wan oi open, an' our guns by our soides."</p>

<p>"It must have been very exciting," said Esther, with
marked interest.</p>

<p>"It certain wuz exciting. It wuz bad, too, ter come
back ter y'r shack an' foind y'r rations gone, or no
shack at all."</p>

<p>"What would you do then?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, we wint hungry till we caught fish, or shot
deer."</p>

<p>Here he lighted his pipe again, and drew long whiffs.</p>

<p>"What were you doing in those days?" questioned
Kenneth.</p>

<p>"Me business wuz always wid cattle. Sometoimes the
Apaches would go off wid some o' me cattle."</p>

<p>"Did you ever get them back?" asked Esther.</p>

<p>"Sometoimes." He smoked in silence a few minutes.</p>

<p>"I understand the Apaches are still treacherous,"
she said.</p>

<p>Just then she felt Wathemah's hand on her arm.</p>

<p>"Wathemah Apache," he said. "He no bad. He
good."</p>

<p>"Yes," she acknowledged, smiling, "you <i>are</i> getting
to be a pretty good boy, dear." Her smile did more
for the child than did the words.</p>

<p>"Pop," said Samuel, "them air Apaches we seen up
canyon t'other day's ben skulkin' aroun'. Yer'd better
carry a gun, schoolma'am."</p>

<p>Supper was now announced, and discussion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Indians ceased. The younger children, joyfully anticipating
the feast before them, had forgotten all their
mother's preliminary instructions on etiquette at table,
and there was a tumultuous scramble.</p>

<p>"Murphy!" called Mrs. Murphy in stentorian tones
as she stood with arms akimbo, "seat schoolma'am at
y'r right!"</p>

<p>With a smile that would have done credit to the
proudest son of Erin, Patrick waved his hand toward
the place of honor. Patrick Junior and his twin Michael
insisted upon sitting in the same seat by their visitor.
What is more, Michael dealt his brother a severe blow
in the mouth to settle his superior claims. To add to
the clamor, Kathleen pressed her right to the same seat.
She screamed lustily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy, family representative of law, started
towards the disturbers of the peace. They dodged.
The teacher hereupon made a suggestion that seemed
to satisfy everyone, and so the matter was settled.</p>

<p>"Set right down, Mr. Hastings, set right down,"
urged Mrs. Murphy. He seated himself at Patrick
Senior's left. They were scarcely seated before Michael
exclaimed, "Ain't we got a good supper!"</p>

<p>He sprawled on the table, looking longingly at the huge
dish of chicken potpie.</p>

<p>"One'd think yer never had nothin' ter eat," observed
Samuel. He seemed to think it devolved upon
him to preserve the decorum of the family.</p>

<p>While the children were waiting impatiently for their
turns, a nudge started at Mrs. Murphy's right and left.
Nine pairs of elbows were resting upon the table. Nine
pairs of eyes were fixed longingly upon the platter of
chicken. Suddenly, as the parental nudge passed along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
nine pairs of elbows moved off the table, and nine figures
sat erect.</p>

<p>The family had been instructed to observe the teacher's
manners at table, "fur," observed Mrs. Murphy,
"there is no better way fur yer to learn eatin' manners
than to notice how folks does. Ef she sets up
straight-like, yer kin do the same. Jest watch her.
Ef she takes her chicken bone in her hand, y' kin; but
ef she cuts her chicken off, why, y' cut yourn off."</p>

<p>Finally, all were served. In the preparation for the
reception of the teacher, the offspring of Mrs. Murphy
had been duly instructed by her to hold each little
finger out stiff and straight while manipulating the
knife and fork. To the dismay of all, Esther did not
take her chicken bone in her hand, nor did she hold
her knife and fork perpendicular, nor did she hold her
little fingers out at a right angle.</p>

<p>The children struggled with their refractory chicken
bones, as they watched the teacher. Patrick Murphy's
eyes were twinkling. But at this juncture, a nudge
from Mrs. Murphy again passed around the table.
Nine pairs of eyes were upon the knife and fork of the
guest. Amanda was filled with admiration as she observed
Esther Bright.</p>

<p>In talking this over afterwards, Samuel said to his
sister:</p>

<p>"Schoolma'am wuz brung up better nor we be. Yer
kin see it by the way she eats. Did yer see how dainty-like
she held her knife and fork?"</p>

<p>"Yer don't know nuthin' about it, Sam," said Mandy.
"I guess I seen her myself."</p>

<p>Just as the last nudge passed around, Patrick laughed
outright.</p>

<p>"Begorra childthren," he said, "is it Frinch stoile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
ter eat wid y'r fingers sthuck out? Phwat ails yez?"</p>

<p>"Pat Murphy," said his wife, "yer never seen good
eatin' manners in y'r life. I hev. Back in York State
where I wuz riz, the very best people in the country
come to them barn raisin's."</p>

<p>Her sharp chin tilted upward; her black eyes grew
brighter.</p>

<p>"Where I growed up, folks set great store by p'liteness.
They allus had clean plates fur pie when they
wuz comp'ny. Yes, Pat Murphy, I wuz well trained,
ef I do say it."</p>

<p>The visitors remained silent. Patrick grinned.</p>

<p>When the teacher's cup was again filled with tea, she
stirred it longer than usual, thinking, possibly, how she
could pour oil on troubled waters. Instantly, around
the table nine other spoons were describing circles in
the bottom of each cup. Again Patrick's eyes laughed.
Mrs. Murphy glowered.</p>

<p>The supper over, and all housewife duties of the day
performed, Mrs. Murphy turned to her offspring, standing
in line,&mdash;at her suggestion,&mdash;on one side of the room.</p>

<p>"Schoolma'am," she said with an air of conscious
superiority, "the childern told me yer wanted 'em to
go to Bible school. Now me an' my childern has all
the 'ligion as we wants. I'll show yer."</p>

<p>"Childern, what is y'r 'ligion?"</p>

<p>"Latter Day Saints," answered Joseph.</p>

<p>"An' who is the prophet o' the Lord?"</p>

<p>"Joseph Smith," piped Kate.</p>

<p>"An' what wuz his relevations?"</p>

<p>"That men should marry lots o' wives, an raise lots
o' childern," answered Jacob.</p>

<p>"Shure, an' did he have rivelations that women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
should be marryin' lots o' husbands?" asked Mr. Murphy
with a chuckle.</p>

<p>This was an interruption Mrs. Murphy could ill
brook. She was on the warpath; but Patrick, the good-natured,
now took matters in his own hands, and spoke
with firmness.</p>

<p>"We'll have no more Mormon talk ter-night. Childthren,
set down."</p>

<p>They sat down. Mrs. Murphy's mouth shut like a
spring trap. She was humiliated; she, a connection, so
to speak, of the Commonses of "Lexity Street, York
City!"</p>

<p>"Whin me woman there," said Patrick, "was lift wid
two babies, Jacob an' Kate, twelve year ago, lift 'way
off in a lonesome place in Utah by her Mormon husband,
Oi felt as though Oi would loike ter go wid some dacint
man, an' give this Mormon who lift his wife an' babies
fur the sake of goin' off wid another woman,&mdash;Oi repate
it,&mdash;Oi'd 'a ben glad ter have give 'im sich a batin' as
he'd remimber ter his dyin' day. He wuz kilt by the
Indians. Whin Oi heerd he wuz kilt, an' knowed fur
shure he wuz dead, Oi persuaded me woman here ter
marry me, an' ter come let me give her an' all her childthren
a dacint home in Arizony.</p>

<p>"Oi don't want ter hear no more about Mormons. Oi
know 'em root an' branch. Oi am a Catholic. Oi belave
in the Holy Mither. Oi belave in good women. Oi
belave as a man should have wan wife, a wife wan husband.
Oi wants me childthren an' me woman's childthren
too, ter come ter y'r Bible school. What's more,
they shall come. Oi wants 'em ter learn about God an'
the Blissed Virgin. Y're a good woman; that Oi know.
An' yez are as good a Catholic as Oi want ter see. Yer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
kin jist count on me fur support in all the good yez are
thryin' ter do in Gila."</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy's face was suppressed fury.</p>

<p>The teacher spoke in a low, gentle voice:</p>

<p>"So you are a Catholic, Mr. Murphy. Do you know,
I have always admired the reverent way Catholics speak
of the mother of Jesus."</p>

<p>Then she turned to Mrs. Murphy, saying:</p>

<p>"I know but little about the belief of the Mormons.
Some day I wish you would tell me about it."</p>

<p>"Mormons are a good sight better'n Catholics,"
snapped Mrs. Murphy. "Intelligent people should know
about 'em, and what they've done fur the world. They
are honest, they don't smoke, nor chew, nor drink. They
are good moral people, they are."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Esther, "I have heard some admirable
things about them."</p>

<p>Kenneth rose to go.</p>

<p>"So you'll not return to Clayton Ranch with me, Miss
Bright."</p>

<p>He knew by the expression of her face that she preferred
to go rather than to stay. But she spoke graciously:</p>

<p>"I have not finished my visit yet."</p>

<p>In a moment more Kenneth was gone.</p>

<p>Then a new difficulty arose. Who was to sleep with
the teacher? Kate, the twins, and Kathleen, all pressed
their claims. After listening to the altercation, Esther
suggested that it would be necessary for her to occupy
the rocking chair by Wathemah, to see that he did not
injure his broken arm, and asked that she be given the
privilege of watching by him throughout the night.</p>

<p>Then the family withdrew. Soon Esther pretended
to be asleep. Occasionally the child reached out and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
touched her arm to make sure his Beloved was there.
Then he fell asleep.</p>

<p>But Esther was wakeful. Why had Kenneth come
for her? Was she coming to care too much for him?
How would it all end? When she at last fell asleep, her
dreams were troubled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>CARLA EARLE</h3>

<p class="cap">S<span class="smcap">chool</span> had been dismissed, and the shadows
had begun to lengthen in the valley. Esther
Bright sat in the doorway of the schoolhouse,
leaning against the jamb of the door, her
hands resting idly in her lap. At last she
lifted a letter she held, and read over again the closing
words, "Thy devoted grandfather, David Bright."</p>

<p>She brushed her hand across her cheek more than
once, as she sat there, looking off, miles away, to her
New England home. She heard a step, and turning,
saw Carla Earle approaching. Before she could rise,
Carla was at her side, half shy, uncertain of herself.
Without the usual preliminary of greeting, Carla said:
"Are you homesick?"</p>

<p>She had seen Esther wipe tears from her cheeks.</p>

<p>"A little. I was thinking of my grandfather, and
how I'd love to see him. I am always homesick when
his letters come. One came to-day."</p>

<p>"I am homesick, too," said Carla, "for my native
land, its green turf, its stately trees, the hedges, the cottages,
the gardens, the flowers and birds&mdash;and&mdash;everything!"</p>

<p>"Sit down, Carla. Let's talk. You are homesick
for your native land, and I am homesick for my grandfather."</p>

<p>She took one of the English girl's hands in hers, and
they talked long of England. At last Carla asked Esther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
to sing for her. For answer, Esther rose, entered
the schoolroom, and returned, bringing her guitar. Then
striking the chords of C Major, she sang softly, "Home,
Sweet Home." As she sang, Carla watched her through
tears.</p>

<p>"An exile from home," the teacher sang; but at that
moment she heard a sob. She stopped singing.</p>

<p>"Go on, please," begged the English girl.</p>

<p>Again the cords vibrated to the touch of Esther's fingers,
and she sang the song that has comforted many a
sorrowing heart.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"There were ninety and nine that safely lay<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In the shelter of the fold;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But one was out on the hills away,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Far off from the gates of gold."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On she sang, her voice growing more pitifully tender.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"But none of the ransomed ever knew<br /></span>
<span class="i4">How deep were the waters crossed;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor how dark the night that the Lord passed through,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Ere He found His sheep that was lost.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Out in the darkness He heard its cry,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Sick and helpless and ready to die."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then as she sang,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"And the angels echoed around the throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">'Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>her voice thrilled with triumphant hope.</p>

<p>Was she inspired, or was it simply that she was about
her Master's business? Her voice seemed a message
from God to the stricken girl who listened. Carla, looking
into the face of Esther Bright, saw there a smile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
that was ineffably sweet; saw, too, the golden light of
the setting sun playing about her face and form.</p>

<p>Song after song was sung from one heart to the other.
The guitar was laid aside. Then hand in hand, the two
girls sat talking till the sunset faded, talking through
falling tears, talking of ideals of life, and of how sweet
and good life may be. Then Esther told of the Blessed
One of Galilee whose love and compassion never fail.
And at last Carla told her her whole sad story.</p>

<p>"But you will leave the saloon, Carla, won't you?
You will throw off Mr. Clifton's influence?" Esther said
as they rose to go. "I can give you shelter until I can
find a home for you, only leave that dreadful place."</p>

<p>"I can't; I love him," she answered. Then, covering
her face with her hands, she wept bitterly.</p>

<p>"You <i>can</i> leave him, I know, and you will in time.
Come often to see me, as you have done to-day. Perhaps
you and I together, with God's help, can find a
way."</p>

<p>They parted at the schoolhouse, Esther returning
home, her heart sorrowful. She thought of One who
centuries before had sought the mountains alone, the
sorrow of a world upon His heart. She understood it
now, understood at least something of the agony of that
sorrow. She went to her room and prayed. When at
last she rose from her knees, her face looked drawn. The
feeling as of a heavy weight upon her heart increased.
How helpless she seemed!</p>

<p>She opened her window wider, and looked up into the
fathomless blue. An overwhelming desire to save the
tempted English girl had taken possession of her. What
should she do?</p>

<p>As she stood thus, she seemed conscious of a presence,
and turned as though expecting to see some one; but no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
one was there. She heard no voice. Notwithstanding
the evidence of her eyes, she could not shake off the feeling
of another presence than her own. She turned again
toward the window, and looked out into the crystal
deeps. Then a strange peace came upon her. It seemed
a foretaste of heaven. She threw herself on the lounge
in her room, and fell into a refreshing sleep.</p>

<p>But what of Carla Earle?</p>

<p>On leaving Esther, she walked slowly toward Keith's
saloon. Suddenly, she put her hand to her heart, staggered,
and gave a sharp cry. Then trembling in every
limb, she turned abruptly, and walked rapidly toward
the canyon. She reached a place that seemed to have a
fascination for her. She looked at the dark pool and
wrung her hands. Her muscles gave way, and she sank
on the bank, while great convulsive sobs shook her frame.
She tried to rise, but her limbs refused to obey her will.
Then it was that her agony of shame, and sorrow, and remorse
burst forth in pitiful cries to God to let her die.
She removed her hat and wrap, and crawled to the verge
of the black pool. She shuddered as she looked. Then
a great horror-stricken cry came from her white lips as
she plunged into the seething waters.</p>

<p>There was the sound of a human voice in answer; and
a moment later, Patrick Murphy plunged after her,
grasped and caught her floating skirt, pulled her by it
to shore, and lifted her up the bank. He began to wring
the water from her skirts.</p>

<p>"Lass, lass," he said, kindly, "what made yez do it?
What's the matter wid yez?"</p>

<p>Great sobs were his only answer. It seemed as though
the girl must die from the agony of her distress.</p>

<p>Then he lifted her in his arms, and carried her to
where he had left his horse. By the dim light, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
recognized Carla Earle, and he at once concluded that
Mark Clifton was responsible for her deed. His first
impulse, like all of his impulses, was a generous one. He
resolved to take her to his home, and become her protector.
As he was about to lift her to his horse's back,
he discovered that she had fainted. He succeeded in
lifting her to the saddle, mounted behind her, and rode
directly to his home.</p>

<p>A few words sufficed to explain to his wife the rescue
of the girl, and the necessity of keeping her whereabouts
a profound secret. Every member of the family was
enjoined to strict silence about the presence of Carla
Earle in their home.</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy undressed Carla and put her in
her own bed. The helplessness of the unconscious girl
appealed to her. After a time, Carla's eyes opened.
She looked startled, and began to rave, writhing and
twisting as one in mortal agony. Now she called on
Mark Clifton to keep his promise to her; now she asked
Wathemah to go for Miss Bright; now she begged God
to take her; now she was on the brink of the pool, and in
the dark water.</p>

<p>So she raved, and the night passed. From time to
time Mrs. Murphy laid wet cloths on Carla's head, or
moistened her lips. The two faithful watchers did not
close their eyes. The day dawned, and they were still
watching; but at last their patient slept.</p>

<p>When Carla finally wakened, she looked around, and
seeing Mrs. Murphy, asked where she was.</p>

<p>"With friends who are going to take good care of
yer," answered her nurse.</p>

<p>"How did I come here?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy explained that her husband had found
her unconscious, and had brought her to his home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
And, leaning down, she did an unprecedented thing.
She kissed Carla Earle. At this Carla began to cry.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, lass, don't cry," said Patrick, who entered
just then. He turned away and blew his nose
violently.</p>

<p>"I must get up and help you," said the sick girl,
trying to rise. But she did not rise that day nor for
many days. Throughout her illness that followed, Mrs.
Murphy's kindness was unstinted. She waited on the
sick girl with unfailing patience. But Brigham was
oftenest at her bedside when home, telling her of his
beloved teacher and what she taught them. At last
Carla begged to see her.</p>

<p>That very day Patrick drove down for Esther, telling
her on their way back to the ranch the particulars of
his finding Carla Earle, and of her subsequent illness.</p>

<p>"You dear, good people!" said Esther, deeply
touched. "I feel so grateful to you."</p>

<p>"Och! That's nothin', Miss," he responded awkwardly.
"Whin Oi see the girl so near desthruction,
Oi sez ter mesilf, sez Oi, what if me sisther or one of me
little girrls wuz iver ter be in the clutches of a Mark
Clifton? So Oi sez ter mesilf, sez Oi, Oi'll jist save
her. That's all there wuz av it. My wife has taken
care o' the lass. An' she has grown that fond av her!
Beats all!"</p>

<p>"God will bless you for saving her, you may be sure
of that," responded Esther heartily. "She must have
gone directly from me to the canyon. I had urged her
to leave Mr. Clifton and come to me, but she did not
seem to have decision enough to promise then. The
canyon must have been an after-thought, and the result
of her despair."</p>

<p>"Poor creetur!" said Patrick, huskily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>When Carla saw Esther, she began to sob, and seemed
greatly disturbed. Her pulse grew more rapid. Such
remorse one seldom sees.</p>

<p>Esther placed her own cool hand on the sick girl's
forehead, and spoke to her in low, soothing tones. Carla
grasped her hand and held it tightly.</p>

<p>"I have wanted to see you and tell you&mdash;" But Esther
interrupted her.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, you shall tell me by and by. Don't try
to tell me now."</p>

<p>"I must. The distress here" (placing her hand over
her heart) "will never go until I tell you. After I left
you at the schoolhouse, I was filled with despair. I felt
so utterly strengthless. Then I prayed. Suddenly it
came to me I must never again return to the saloon or&mdash;him.
I seemed to have strength given me to go on
and on in the opposite direction. All I remember now
is that I resolved to make it impossible to return. Then
I awakened here. They have been so kind to me, especially
little Brigham. He comes in to see me as soon
as he returns from school, and talks to me about you,
and it comforts me."</p>

<p>"God has been leading you, Carla," said Esther. "I
am sure of that. And He raised up this kind friend
to save you in your dark hour. But the dark hour is
past now, and we are going to help you learn how to
grow happy."</p>

<p>"Can one learn how to grow happy who has made
such a blunder of life?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. And it is a blessed lesson to learn."</p>

<p>When Esther left, she promised to return on the
morrow.</p>

<p>That evening, there was a family council at Clayton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Ranch, and the result of it was that Mrs. Clayton herself
soon went to see Carla, and invited her to make her
home with them.</p>

<p>So it came about that Carla Earle became one of the
Clayton household; and in the loving, helpful atmosphere
of that home, she began to lift up her lovely head,
as does an early blossoming flower in the April sunshine
after it has been nipped by an untimely frost. And
life, with love enfolding her every hour of each happy
day, began to grow worth while to the English girl.</p>

<p>And Carla grew into the affection of the family, for
she was a refined, winsome creature. She became as
a daughter to Mrs. Clayton.</p>

<p>One day Mrs. Clayton said to her husband:</p>

<p>"Do you notice how much Carla is growing like our
Miss Bright?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he responded. "There is something very attractive
about both. Only Miss Bright is a remarkably
well-poised woman, and Carla is clinging and dependent.
Poor Carla! How bitterly she has been wronged!
I am glad she has found love and shelter at last."</p>

<p>"So am I, John. Why, the poor child was just
starved for love."</p>

<p>"I believe, Mary, that she will develop into a strong
character. What she has suffered has been a great lesson
to her."</p>

<p>"Poor child! Sometimes when I speak appreciative
words to her, she breaks down, and says she doesn't
deserve all our kindness. One day when she cried, she
said, 'Why does God take mothers away from their
children when they need them so?'"</p>

<p>"Well," he responded, "she has at last found a good
mother. God bless the mother and the unfortunate girl!"</p>

<p>And stooping, the husband kissed his wife, and
started on a long journey to a distant mine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<h3>AN EVENTFUL DAY</h3>

<p class="cap">A<span class="smcap">fter</span> Esther Bright and Wathemah returned
from their visit at Murphy Ranch, he became
a guest at the Clayton home, and
there he remained until his arm was well.</p>

<p>His sojourn with them strengthened his
devotion to Esther Bright, and brought about several
changes for the better in him.</p>

<p>When he was allowed to run and play with the children
again, he returned to school and to Keith's saloon.</p>

<p>The men who had always called him the "little
tough," now observed him with amazement. One observed:</p>

<p>"I'll be blowed ef the Angel o' the Gila can't do anythin'
she wants ter. See that kid? He used ter cuss
like a pirate. Do ye hear him cuss now? No, sir!
For why? 'Cause he knows she don't like it. That's
why. Ef she wuz ter be turned loose among the
Apaches, she'd civilize 'em. An' they're the blankedest
Indians there be. I don't know what it is about
her. She sort o' makes a feller want ter be somebody.
I reckon God Almighty knows more about 'er nor we
do, 'n' she knows more about us 'n' we do ourselves.
Leastways, she do about me."</p>

<p>Having delivered himself to this effect, he left the
saloon, sober.</p>

<p>There is no doubt Esther Bright had sown good seed
broadcast, and some had fallen on good ground. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
awakening of the cowlasses had been a continual joy
to her. She marveled that some one had not found
them before. Each successive day the little school
reached out further to enrich the life of the community.</p>

<p>One morning, while a class was in the midst of a
recitation, there came a knock at the schoolhouse door.</p>

<p>"I'm Robert Duncan," said a Scotch miner, as
Esther opened the door. He held by the hand a little
boy of about three years.</p>

<p>"This is Bobbie," he continued. "I've brought me
bairn tae school."</p>

<p>Could the mother spare such a baby? Ah, could she?</p>

<p>Esther stooped and held out her arms to the child,
but he hid behind his father.</p>

<p>"His mither died last week, Miss," he said with a
choke in his voice. "I'd like tae leave him with ye."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry," she replied, with quick sympathy.
Then she promised to receive Bobbie as a pupil, providing
he would stay.</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll stay," the father hastened to say, "if
ye'll just call Donald."</p>

<p>So Donald was called, and he succeeded in coaxing
Bobbie into the schoolroom.</p>

<p>When the child realized that his father had gone and
left him, he ran to the door, crying, "Faither!
Faither!" while tears rolled down his cheeks.</p>

<p>Then the mother heart of Esther Bright asserted itself.
She gathered him in her arms and soothed him, until
he cuddled down contentedly and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Soon after, Kenneth Hastings appeared at the open
door, and saw Esther at her desk with the sleeping
child in her arms. He heard her speaking in a soft
tone to the children as she dismissed them for the morning
recess; but Bobbie wakened frightened. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
moment Kenneth entered, Bobbie was carried out of the
room by Donald, the other children following.</p>

<p>"I came to see if you could go for a horseback ride
this afternoon," said Kenneth. "It's a glorious day."</p>

<p>"Just delighted! Nothing would please me better."</p>

<p>The two stood inside the open door. As Wathemah
saw Kenneth talking to his teacher, he entered the door,
pushed between them, nestled close to her, and said
defiantly:</p>

<p>"Miss Bright <i>me</i> teacher; <i>mine</i>!"</p>

<p>"Yours, eh, sonny?" said Kenneth, smiling. Then
looking into Esther's face, he said:</p>

<p>"I wish I could feel as sure that some day you will
be mine."</p>

<p>A delicate flush swept over her face. When he went
on his way, life and vigor were in every step. He
seemed to walk on air.</p>

<p>The recess over, the children returned to their seats,
and Patrick Murphy entered. The school, for the hour,
was transformed into a place of general merchandise,
for the teacher had promised that to-day they would
play store, buy and sell. Business was to be done on
a strictly cash basis, and accounts kept. Several children
had been busy for days, making school money.
Scales for weighing, and various measures were in evidence.</p>

<p>Patrick watched the play of the children, as they
weighed and measured, bought and sold.</p>

<p>At the close of the exercises, he turned to Esther,
saying:</p>

<p>"Oi wisht Oi wuz young agin mesilf. Yez larn the
chilthren more in wan hour, 'n' many folks larns in
a loife toime. It's thankful Oi am that yez came ter
Gila, fur the school is gittin' on."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>Having delivered himself of this compliment, he withdrew,
highly pleased with himself, with the teacher,
with the school, and the world generally. If there was
one thing that met with Patrick's unqualified approval,
it was "to git on."</p>

<p>Near the close of the midday intermission, during the
absence of Wathemah, Donald Carmichael said to the
teacher, "Ye love Wathemah mair nor the rest o' us, don't
ye?"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Esther, as she smiled down at the
urchin.</p>

<p>"Oh," hanging his head, "ye say 'Wathemah' as
though ye likit him mair nor anybody else."</p>

<p>"As though I loved him?"</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"Well," she acknowledged, "I do love Wathemah.
I love all the other children, too. Don't you think I
ought to love Wathemah a little better because he has
no father or mother, as you have, to love him?"</p>

<p>Donald thought not.</p>

<p>"You have no idea," said Carla, who now attended
school, "what brutal treatment Wathemah used to receive
at the saloon. I have seen him teased and trounced
and knocked around till he was frantic. And the men
took delight in teaching him all the badness they knew.
I used to hear them while I was helping Mrs. Keith."
Carla's eyes suddenly filled.</p>

<p>"Poor little fellow!" said Esther, in response.</p>

<p>"I shall never forget his happiness," continued Carla,
"the first day he went to school. He came to me and
said he liked his teacher and wanted to go live with
her."</p>

<p>"Did he? Bless his heart!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"After that," Carla went on to say, "he came to me
every morning to see if he was clean enough to go to
school."</p>

<p>"So <i>you</i> were the good fairy, Carla, who wrought the
transformation in him. He certainly was a very dirty
little boy the first morning he came to school, but he
has been pretty clean ever since."</p>

<p>Donald, who had been listening, now spoke up again.</p>

<p>"Oh, Wathemah's all right, only I thocht ye likit
him mair nor the rest o' us."</p>

<p>"No, she don't, neither," stoutly maintained Brigham.
"I guess I know. She's always fair."</p>

<p>At this moment, Wathemah himself drew near. He
had been to the timber for mistletoe, and returned with
his arms full of sprays of green, covered with white
waxen berries. He walked proudly to his Beloved, and
gave her his offering. Then he stepped back and surveyed
her.</p>

<p>"Wathemah love he teacher," he said in a tone of
deep satisfaction.</p>

<p>"She ain't yourn, ye Apache savage," cried Donald.
"She don't love ye; she said so," added the child, maliciously.</p>

<p>Like a flash, Wathemah was upon him, beating him
with all his strength. He took the law into his own
hands, settled his score, and laid his opponent out before
Esther could interfere. When she grasped Wathemah's
arm, he turned upon her like a tiger.</p>

<p>"Donald lie!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Yes, Donald did lie," she conceded, "but <i>you</i> should
not punish him."</p>

<p>"Donald call savage. Wathemah kill he!"</p>

<p>The teacher continued to hold him firmly. She tried
to reason with him, but her words made no impression.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>The child stood resolute. He lifted a scornful finger
toward Donald, and said in a tone of contempt:</p>

<p>"Donald lie. Wathemah no lie."</p>

<p>The teacher released him, and told him to see her
after school. Then the afternoon session began. But
Wathemah's place was vacant.</p>

<p>As the hours passed, it became evident that Donald
was not as happy as usual. He was in disgrace. At
last his class was called. He hung his head in shame.
Esther did not press him to recite.</p>

<p>The hour for dismissal came. The little culprit sat
alone in the farther corner of the room. Carla started
out to find Wathemah.</p>

<p>The loud accusing tick of the clock beat upon Donald's
ear. The teacher was busy, and at first paid no attention
to him. She heard a sniffling in the corner. Still
no attention. At last she sat down by the lad, and
said very gently:</p>

<p>"Tell me about it, Donald."</p>

<p>No answer. He averted his face, and rubbed his
dirty fists into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Tell me why you lied to Wathemah, Donald."</p>

<p>Still no answer.</p>

<p>"How could you hurt his feelings so?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>Then Esther talked to him till he buried his face in
his arms and sobbed. She probed down into his heart.
At last she asked him what he thought he should do.
Still silence. She waited. The clock ticked louder and
louder in the ears of the child: "Say it! Say it! Say
it!"</p>

<p>At last he spoke.</p>

<p>"I ought tae tell Wathemah I lied; but I dinna want
tae tell him afore the lads."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!" she said, "but you said your untruthful words
before them; and unless you are a coward, your apology
ought to be before them."</p>

<p>"I am nae coward," he said, lifting his head.</p>

<p>"Then you must apologize to Wathemah before the
children to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Yes, mum."</p>

<p>Then she dismissed him, telling him to remember
what he had done, when he prayed to God that night.</p>

<p>"Did God hear me lie?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I think so, Donald."</p>

<p>The child looked troubled.</p>

<p>"I didna think o' that. I'll tell Him I'm sorry,"
he said as he left the schoolroom.</p>

<p>He began to search for Wathemah, that he might make
peace with him.</p>

<p>At first Carla's search was fruitless. Then she sought
him in a place she knew he loved, away up the canyon.
There, sure enough, she found him. He sat on a bowlder
near a cascade with his back toward her. Beyond him,
on the other side of the stream, rose the overhanging
cliffs. He did not hear her step as he listened to the
music of the waters.</p>

<p>"Wathemah!" she called. He started, then turned
toward her. She saw that he had been crying. She
climbed up on the bowlder and sat down beside him.</p>

<p>"Donald lie!" he said, angrily.</p>

<p>"Yes, Wathemah, but he is sorry for it, and I am
sure will tell you so."</p>

<p>She saw tears roll down the dirty little face. She had
the wisdom to leave him alone; and walking a short distance
up the canyon, sent pebbles skipping the water.
After a while this drew him to her.</p>

<p>"Shall we go up stream?" she asked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>He nodded. They jumped from bowlder to bowlder,
and at last stopped where the waters go softly, making
a soothing music for the ear.</p>

<p>"Carla!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Wathemah."</p>

<p>"Jesus forgive?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, He does." Then Carla's self-control gave
way, and she sobbed out her long-suppressed grief. Instantly
the child's arms were around her neck.</p>

<p>"No cry, Carla!" he said. "No cry, Carla!" patting
her cheek.</p>

<p>Then, putting his tear-stained cheek close to hers,
he said:</p>

<p>"Jesus love Carla."</p>

<p>She gathered the little comforter in her arms; and
though her tears fell fast, they brought relief to her
heart.</p>

<p>At last she persuaded him to return to school the
following day, and to do all he could to atone for leaving
it without permission.</p>

<p>On their return, they sought the teacher in the schoolhouse,
but she was gone, and the door was locked; neither
was she to be found at the Clayton ranch. The little
penitent lingered a long time, but his Beloved did not
come. At last he walked reluctantly in to camp.</p>

<p>Away up the mountain road, Esther Bright and
Kenneth Hastings drew rein. The Englishman sat his
horse well; but it was evident his companion was not
a horsewoman. She might shine in a drawing-room or
in a home, but not on a horse's back. If she had not
been riding one of the finest saddle horses in the country,
she would have appeared to greater disadvantage.</p>

<p>The canter up the mountain road had brought the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
color to her cheeks. It had also shaken out her hairpins;
and now her wavy brown hair, with its glint of
gold, tumbled about her shoulders.</p>

<p>"You look like a gypsy," Kenneth was saying.</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"The last gypsies I ever saw," she said merrily,
"were encamped along the road through Beekman's
Woods, as you approach Tarrytown-on-Hudson from
the north. The gypsy group was picturesque, but the
individuals looked villainous. I hope I do not strongly
resemble them," she said still laughing; then added,
"They wanted to tell our fortunes."</p>

<p>"Did you let them tell yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just for fun."</p>

<p>"What did they tell you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just foolishness."</p>

<p>"Come, tell <i>me</i> just for fun."</p>

<p>"Well,"&mdash;here she blushed&mdash;"the old gypsy told me
that an Englishman would woo me, that I'd not know
my own mind, and that I would reject him."</p>

<p>"Interesting! Go on."</p>

<p>"That something dreadful would happen to the suitor;
that I'd help take care of him, and after that, all was
cloudland."</p>

<p>"Really, this grows more interesting. The fortune
teller realized how hard-hearted you were. Didn't she
ask you to join their caravan? You'd make an ideal
gypsy princess."</p>

<p>Esther touched her horse with her whip. He gave
a sudden lunge, and sped onward like mad. It was all
she could do to sit her horse. Before her, to her dismay,
yawned a deep gulch. She could not stop her horse
now, of that she was sure. She tightened her grip, and
waited. She heard the sound of hoofs behind her, and
Kenneth's voice shouting "Whoa!" As well shriek at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
a tornado to stop. She seemed to catch the spirit of
the horse. The pupils of her eyes dilated. She felt
the quivering of the beast when, for a moment, he reared
on his haunches. Then she felt herself borne through
the air, as the animal took the gulch; then she knew
that he was struggling up the bank. In a moment the
beast stopped, quivering all through his frame; his
nostrils were dilated, and his breath came hard.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Kenneth Hastings overtook her. It
was evident he had been alarmed.</p>

<p>"You have done a perilous thing for an inexperienced
rider," he said. "It is dumb luck that you have
escaped unhurt. I expected to find you injured or
dead."</p>

<p>"I was dreadfully scared when we came to the gulch.
I didn't know about it, you know; but I couldn't stop
the horse then."</p>

<p>"Of course not. What made the animal run? Did
you cut him with the whip?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I thought it'd
be such fun to run away from
you for calling me a gypsy."</p>

<p>He laughed. Then he looked grave.</p>

<p>Suddenly Esther Bright grew as cold as ice, and
swayed in the saddle. At last she was forced to say
she was ill. Her companion dismounted and lifted her
from the saddle.</p>

<p>"Why, how you tremble!" he was saying. "How cold
you are!"</p>

<p>"Just fright," she replied, making an effort to rally.
"I am ashamed of being scared. The fright has made
me deathly sick." Even her lips were white. He
seemed deeply concerned.</p>

<p>After a while her color returned, and she assured
him that she was able to go on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"But are you sure?" he asked, showing the deepest
concern.</p>

<p>"Quite sure," she said, positively. "Come, let us
go. I have given you enough trouble already."</p>

<p>"No trouble, I assure you."</p>

<p>He did not add that the very fact that she had
needed a service from him was sufficient recompense.</p>

<p>Then they walked their horses homeward, talking of
many things of common interest to them.</p>

<p>Down in the valley, the soft gray of the dead gramma
grass was relieved by the great beds of evergreen cacti,
yucca, and the greenery of the sage and mesquite.
The late afterglow in the sky mingled with the purple
haze that hung like an ethereal veil over the landscape.</p>

<p>They stopped their horses at a turn of the road commanding
a fine view of the mountains.</p>

<p>"How beautiful the world is everywhere!" Esther
said, half to herself.</p>

<p>"Especially in Arizona," said Kenneth, as he drew
a deep invigorating breath.</p>

<p>Silence again.</p>

<p>"Miss Bright," he hesitated. "I believe the world
would be beautiful to me anywhere, if you were there."</p>

<p>"You flatter," she said, lifting her hand as if to ward
off what might follow.</p>

<p>"No flattery. Since you came, the whole world has
seemed beautiful to me."</p>

<p>"I am glad if my coming has improved your vision,"
she said merrily. "Come, we must hasten, or we'll
be late for dinner. You are to dine with us to-night,
I believe."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Clayton was so kind as to invite me."</p>

<p>Again her horse took the lead. Kenneth touched his
with the whip, and overtook her. For some distance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the horses were neck and neck. As they came to a steep
ascent, they slackened their pace.</p>

<p>Her eyes were sparkling, and she was in excellent
spirits.</p>

<p>"If I were a better horsewoman," she said gayly,
"I'd challenge you to a race."</p>

<p>"Why not, anyway?" he suggested. "There are no
more gulches."</p>

<p>"I might not be able to stick on."</p>

<p>"We'll try it," he responded, encouragingly, "over
the next level stretch."</p>

<p>So try it they did. They flew like the wind. The
cool evening air, the excitement of the race, the rich
afterglow in the heavens,&mdash;all were exhilarating. On
they sped, on and on, till they turned into the canyon
road. Again Esther's horse led, but Kenneth soon overtook
her, and then their horses walked slowly on together
the rest of the way.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you are as happy as I am," he said,
as he assisted her from the saddle.</p>

<p>"I am in the positive degree of happiness," she said,
cheerily. "I am always happy except when shadowed
by someone else's sorrow."</p>

<p>He said something to her about bearing all her future
sorrows for her, adding:</p>

<p>"That is becoming the dearest wish of my heart."</p>

<p>"All must meet sorrow sometime," she responded
gravely. "I hope to meet mine with fortitude when
it comes."</p>

<p>She stood stroking the horse's neck.</p>

<p>"I wish I might help you to bear it when it comes.
Oh, Miss Bright," he said, earnestly, "I wish I could
make you realize how I honor you&mdash;and dare I say it?&mdash;how
I love you! I wish you would try to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
me. I am not trifling. I am in earnest." He looked
at her downcast face.</p>

<p>"I will try," she said, looking up frankly, with no
trace of coquetry in her voice or manner.</p>

<p>There had been moments when Kenneth's love for
Esther had led him to speak dearer words to her than
her apparent interest in him would warrant. At such
times she would retire within herself, surrounded by
an impenetrable reserve. Kenneth Hastings was the
only one she ever treated icily. One day he would be
transported to the seventh heaven; another, he would
sink to the deeps of gloom.</p>

<p>It was several days after this ride that he chanced
to meet Esther in the path along the river road. He
stopped her, and asked abruptly:</p>

<p>"Why do you treat me so frigidly sometimes?"</p>

<p>"Do I?" she asked in surprise.</p>

<p>He remained silent.</p>

<p>"Do I?" she said, repeating her question.</p>

<p>"Yes, you do. Why do you treat me so?"</p>

<p>She looked distressed.</p>

<p>"I didn't realize I had treated you discourteously,
Mr. Hastings. If I did, it was because I am afraid of
you."</p>

<p>"Preposterous! Afraid of me!" Now he was smiling.</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;" As she hesitated, she looked up at
him in an appealing manner.</p>

<p>"Perhaps what?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is because you have given me a glimpse
of your own heart, and have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have what?"</p>

<p>"&mdash;asked me to reveal mine to you. I can't."</p>

<p>"In other words, you do not love me?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"I honor you as I do several people I know. Nothing
more."</p>

<p>There was a long pause. Kenneth was the first to
speak.</p>

<p>"Your friendship! Am I to be deprived of that,
too?"</p>

<p>"My friendship is already yours," she said. "You
know that."</p>

<p>"I thank you. I need hardly tell you that your
friendship is the dearest thing I know."</p>

<p>Then Kenneth left her, and she walked on alone. But
still those words kept repeating themselves in her mind
like a haunting melody, "Your friendship is the dearest
thing I know!" and, like Banquo's ghost, they would
not down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>CHRISTMAS DAY</h3>

<p class="cap">I<span class="smcap">t</span> was Christmas morning, early. Not a leaf was
stirring. The stillness seemed aware. The sun
rose in solemn majesty, heralded by scarlet runners
of the sky. Just as it burst forth from behind
the sleeping mountains, a splendor of coloring
beyond the power of man to describe flooded the
earth and the covering dome of the heavens. Then the
snowy mountain peaks, grim sentinels of the ages, grew
royal in crimson and gold. And the far-stretching
valley, where the soft gray of dead gramma grass was
relieved by the yellowish tint of desert soil, took on the
glory of the morning. From zenith to horizon, the
crystal clearness seemed for one supreme moment ashine
with sifted gold. But, as if to protect the eyes of man
from the too great splendor of this anniversary of
Christ's natal day, a faint purple veil of haze dropped
over the distant mountains. The waters of the Gila
caught the glory of the morning, and became molten
gold.</p>

<p>When the Gilaites awakened, the gladness of the morning
was upon them; and men and women remembered,
some of them for the first time in years, that it was
Christmas day, and went about with "Merry Christmas"
on their lips.</p>

<p>To the children of Gila, the day that had heretofore
been as all other days, now took on new meaning. They
had come to associate it with a wonderful personality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
they were learning to know through their teacher.
Christ's birthday she had called Christmas day, Christ
their elder brother, Christ the lover of children.</p>

<p>They had seen the splendor of the morning. What
wonder that some of them were touched with a feeling
of awe?</p>

<p>For the first time in the history of Gila, Christmas
day was to be observed, and every child had come to
feel a personal interest in the celebration.</p>

<p>The preparations for the evening exercises to be held
in the schoolhouse had all been so new, so mysteriously
interesting! Expectation ran high. Word had spread
to the burro camps on the mountains, and to the Mexicans
tending the charcoal pits up the canyon. Rumors
had reached other camps also, miles away.</p>

<p>The Mexicans, as was their custom, had prepared immense
bonfires on the mountains and foothills for firing
Christmas night. But hearing of the approaching entertainment
at the schoolhouse, they caught the spirit
of the hour and outdid themselves.</p>

<p>The saguaro, or giant cactus, sometimes called the
sentinel of the desert, is one of the most interesting varieties
of the cactus family. Sometimes it grows in the
form of a fluted column, many times reaching a height
of sixty feet. Often at a distance of perhaps thirty
feet from the ground, this cactus throws out fleshy arms
at right angles, which, after a short distance, shoot upward
in columns parallel to the main column, giving the
cactus the appearance of a giant candelabrum. The
saguaro has a skeleton of woody ribs bound together
by tough, woody fibers. In the living cactus, this framework
is filled and covered with green pulp; but when
the cactus dies, the pulp dries and is blown away. The
ribs are covered with quantities of resinous thorns that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
burn like pitch. The dead saguaro, therefore, when
set on fire, becomes a most effective bonfire, having frequently
been used by the Indians, in early days, as a
signal fire.</p>

<p>On this special occasion, the Mexicans had found
several of these dead sentinels of the desert so nearly
in the shape of a Roman cross that a few blows from
an ax made them perfectly so. When lighted Christmas
night, the burning crosses on the mountains loomed
up against the sky, no longer symbols of triumphant
hate, but of triumphant love.</p>

<p>Early that day, what the Mexicans had done began
to be noised abroad; and with every bulletin that passed
from mouth to mouth, interest in the approaching service
at the schoolhouse deepened. It looked as though
the room could not hold all who would come.</p>

<p>The young folk had been generous helpers, and had
decorated the place with spruce, pine, cedar and mistletoe.
The air was heavy with spicy fragrance. Around
the room were huge altar candles in improvised candlesticks
of wood. Across one end of the room, was stretched
a large sheet of white cotton cloth.</p>

<p>For many a day, John Clayton, Kenneth Hastings
and Esther Bright had formed a mysterious triumvirate.
The two men had been seen bringing packages from the
distant station. What it might mean became an absorbing
topic of conversation. One thing was certain,
Gila was alive.</p>

<p>On Christmas morning, these three, accompanied by
Mrs. Carmichael, met at the schoolhouse to make their
final preparations. The beautiful silver spruce, selected
for the Christmas tree, stood out from the dark greenery
of the room. It was a beautiful tree, exquisite in color,
perfect in symmetry, spicy in fragrance. They decorated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
this with ornaments, then began to hang gifts
on its branches. At one side of the tree, Esther stacked
small pasteboard boxes close and high. What these
contained, only she herself knew; and she preserved a
mysteriously interesting silence.</p>

<p>As the four busied themselves at their happy task,
Mrs. Carmichael suddenly uncovered a huge basket she,
thus far, had managed to conceal. She looked a culprit
as she said:</p>

<p>"An' whaur would ye be wishin' the cookies put?"</p>

<p>"Cookies!" they all exclaimed, with one accord,
"Cookies!"</p>

<p>Esther sampled one.</p>

<p>"They're just as good as they look!" she said.
"What a lot of them! How did you come to think of
it? How good of you!"</p>

<p>"It was Donald. He telt me aboot y'r birthday
cakes for the wains. So I thocht bein's it was the
Maister's birthday, each should hae a birthday cake.
A makit one hundred."</p>

<p>"One hundred!" Kenneth whistled. "You know
how to find the way to men's hearts," he laughed.
"But you found your way to mine long ago."</p>

<p>"Fie, fie," she said smiling. "I ken ye weel."</p>

<p>When their preparations were completed, they looked
about with an air of satisfaction. It was evident the
spirit of Christmas had taken possession of them. Such
kindness! Such good will!</p>

<p>Jack Harding was the last to leave the room. Before
he closed and locked the door, he deposited some packages
in an obscure corner.</p>

<p>An hour before the time for the entertainment, the
little adobe schoolhouse was surrounded by people, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
they continued to come even after the teacher, accompanied
by the Claytons, opened the door. Soon every
seat was filled; then, all standing space. Then the windows
were crowded with faces. Still there were as
many more outside who could not hope to see, but
might possibly hear.</p>

<p>Those fortunate enough to enter the room sniffed the
fragrance of cedar and spruce. The burning mesquite
wood in the fireplace snapped and crackled, and the
soft light from the huge candles idealized the beauty
of the tree and the woodsy decorations of the room.
And there was the teacher also, <i>their</i> teacher (for did
she not belong to them?) young, lovely, doing all this
for them! They noted every detail of her simple gray
toilet, even to the soft lace at her throat. There was
something exquisite about her that night as she stood
before them in the yellow candle-light. Her face was
luminous. Kenneth Hastings observed it, and said in
a low tone to his friend John Clayton, "See Miss Bright's face! I never saw anything more
lovely. The spirit of Christmas is in it."</p>

<p>John Clayton placed his hand on his friend's shoulder
as he responded, "Yes. It's all due to her beautiful, generous soul."</p>

<p>After several Christmas carols were sung, he told them
Miss Bright would now address them. There was an
approving murmur.</p>

<p>Then she told them the old, old story, dearest story
of childhood, of the little child in the khan at Bethlehem,
of the star, of the song of the angels, the coming of
the shepherds, and the search by the Wise Men, as they
came with their rich gifts of gold and frankincense and
myrrh, to lay them at the Christ-child's feet. She told
the story briefly and simply.</p>

<p>Among those who listened there that night were Mexicans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
and half-breed Indians, Englishmen, Irishmen,
Scotchmen and Americans. There were Catholics and
Protestants, Mormons, and men of no faith whatever.
There were four university-bred men; there were also
men and women of deepest ignorance; and there were
many others between these extremes.</p>

<p>While the voice of the teacher still held their attention,
John Harding and Kenneth Hastings put out the
lights, and picture after picture, illustrating the early
life of Christ (all copies of famous paintings), flashed
upon the white screen. There were exclamations of
approval such as these:</p>

<p>"Did yez iver now?"</p>

<p>"The Holy Mother! Bless her!"</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;Oh!&mdash;Oh!" in faint whispers.</p>

<p>When Murillo's "Holy Family" appeared, there was
a hush. As it disappeared, some one asked for it again.
After complying with this request, the candles were relighted,
and the distribution of gifts began. There was
a subdued hum of interest. These men and women,
throwing aside care and toil for an hour, were as pleased
as children.</p>

<p>As gifts were passed, many began to realize what the
extra meetings at the schoolhouse had meant. The children
had been making things, and had made them well.
They had been engaged in manual training, though the
teacher had not called it that. She was in advance of
the age, and was doing practical work in manual training
years before the pedagogues of the land had wakened
to the necessity of training the hand.</p>

<p>The Gila children had made gingham aprons for
mothers and sisters; they had crocheted lace and mats;
they had made articles for domestic use, and so on.</p>

<p>When a new blouse waist and a pair of suspenders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
were given to Wathemah, his delight knew no bounds.
Kenneth and Jack Harding stood watching him. The
child was a favorite with both.</p>

<p>"Do you like your waist, little chap?" asked
Kenneth.</p>

<p>"Yes!&mdash;Me!&mdash;Pretty!" said the child, patting and
smoothing his waist as if it were an object of affection.
Then he held his suspenders up for his two friends to
see.</p>

<p>"Do you like 'em, sonny?" asked Jack Harding.</p>

<p>"Mine! Mine!&mdash;S'penders!&mdash;Wathemah's s'penders!"</p>

<p>The grown-ups smiled. The day had unlocked many
a heart long barred and bolted against human sympathy.</p>

<p>"Two dolls, one for Nora and one for Kathleen Murphy,"
called out the superintendent.</p>

<p>"Did yez iver?" said Patrick, smiling with good
humor, from the crown of his bristly head to the extremity
of his bristly chin.</p>

<p>Gifts were passed to right and left. It seemed wonderful
so many should be remembered. Some received their
gifts with undisguised pleasure,&mdash;pleasure so out of proportion
to the intrinsic value of the gifts, it was pathetic.
Esther felt her eyes brimming. More than one said to
her that night that it was the first time he or she had
ever received a Christmas present.</p>

<p>As yet Brigham had received no gifts, but he sat by
Wathemah, apparently enjoying what his friend had
received as though it had been his own. But when
his turn came, and his Beloved brought him three books
about animals, he seemed embarrassed, and stammered
out:</p>

<p>"For me? All thim for me?"</p>

<p>The teacher stood smiling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, for you, dear."</p>

<p>In a short time he and Wathemah, with heads close
together, were lost in one of these books.</p>

<p>Esther watched them from time to time. It was evident
to every one in Gila, that Brigham and Wathemah
were very intimate friends of their teacher's. Brigham
had confided to Kenneth that he was "intimater with
her nor anybody else, 'cause she loved him, an' he loved
her best of anybody in the world." He had likewise
confided to Kenneth his great desire to have some animal
books, as he called them. And Kenneth had seen to it
that he should not be disappointed.</p>

<p>Suddenly, to her surprise, Esther Bright was presented
with a new chair, and was asked to be seated in
it. The excitement of the children rose. This, to them,
was the important moment of the evening.</p>

<p>As one homely little gift after another was presented
to her,&mdash;all the work of children's hands, she spoke
homely, loving words out of her heart. Several coat
sleeves were put to a new use, and some clean gingham
aprons actually found their way to women's cheeks. A
loving-hearted woman had entered their lives and found
them worth while. What wonder that she became to
them, more than ever, what they had called her at first
in ridicule, but later in respect and affection and reverence,&mdash;the
angel of the Gila?</p>

<p>When Esther Bright's lap was full of gifts, she tried
to express what she felt. Her words had vanished, and
happy tears had taken their place.</p>

<p>After her unsuccessful effort to speak, Wathemah,
who could hardly comprehend her tears, ran to her, and
began to wipe them away with a sleeve of his new waist.
She slipped her arm about him and drew him to her.
He looked up questioningly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's all right, Wathemah," she said, smiling. "I
was so happy I couldn't help crying."</p>

<p>"Now," said the superintendent, "you are each to
receive from Miss Bright a Bible, a box of candy and a
Christmas card; and from Mrs. Carmichael, some delicious
Christmas cookies. Here, boys," he said, beckoning
to some of them, "pass these, will you?"</p>

<p>Esther Bright herself took a large panful of cookies to
the people outside of the schoolhouse. As she approached
a Mexican, she saw standing by him his wife,
a blanket Indian, and on her back, a pappoose. As she
passed the cakes to them, the squaw reached down and
grabbed two handfuls of them, devouring them ravenously.</p>

<p>Esther patted the child, and smiled into the squaw's
face, which she could see distinctly in the light that
streamed from the window.</p>

<p>"Pappoose?" she said to the Indian.</p>

<p>But there was no answering smile in the squaw's eyes.
The "emptiness of ages" was in her face. It was a face
Esther was to see again under very different circumstances;
but no premonition warned her of the fiery ordeal
through which she would be called to pass.</p>

<p>Finally the multitude was fed. The boisterous laughter
and the loud talk, within, seemed strangely out of
harmony with the solemn stillness of the night. The
moon sent a flood of silvery light over the scene before
her; and, everywhere, the Christmas fires, built by the
Mexicans, were leaping skyward. Esther stood watching;
for on far away mountains and near by foothills,
the sentinels of the desert had become gigantic burning
crosses. She had heard that these were to be a unique
feature of the Christmas celebration, but she was not
prepared for the exceeding beauty of it all. The burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
cross caught her fancy. Suddenly, she became aware
of the presence of Kenneth Hastings.</p>

<p>"Wonderfully beautiful,&mdash;the scene,&mdash;isn't it?" she
said, without turning. "I think I have never seen anything
more impressive."</p>

<p>"Yes, beautiful. These Catholic Mexicans have a religious
feeling that finds expression in splendor. Does
the burning cross have any significance to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, speaking slowly, as she looked
toward one of them; "the cross, once a symbol of ignominy;
but now become, like the flaming cross on the
mountains, a symbol of light."</p>

<p>"Miss Bright," said John Clayton, from the doorway,
"you are asked for."</p>

<p>As she entered the room, Patrick Murphy stepped forward.
He raised his hand for attention. After several
gibes from the men, and witty retorts on his part, the
company quieted down again.</p>

<p>"Ladies an' gintlemin," he said, flourishing his empty
pipe, as he made an elaborate gesture, "it's mesilf as
feels as we have wid us a foine Christian lady. Ez Oi
watched the picters av the Holy Mither this avenin', Oi
sez ter mesilf, sez Oi, our teacher (the saints bliss her!)
is as lovin' ter the children av this school, as is the
blissid Virgin ter the child in thim picters. Oi sez ter
mesilf, this lady is as good a Catholic as Oi wish ter see.
An' she learns 'em all ter git on. Oi'll sind ivery child
o' mine ter day school an' Bible school. Oi hope yez'll
all do the same."</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy's face was a suppressed thunder-storm;
but Patrick was oblivious of this as he talked on.</p>

<p>"This was a godless region. Miss Bright come like a
angel ter tell us av our sins. Oi belave the Lord sint
her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"See what she done fur us! Her nate little talk ter
us, the picters an' her prisints. All who wish ter thank
our koind frind, join wid me in three cheers fur Miss
Bright!"</p>

<p>Then cheer on cheer rose from the people.</p>

<p>As Patrick took his seat, John Clayton rose.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, "three cheers for our good friend,
Mrs. Carmichael, who made the Christmas cookies."</p>

<p>Again the hearty cheers echoed on the still night air.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Carmichael raised a protesting hand. She
didn't deserve such a compliment, she said.</p>

<p>Then the guests went their various ways. John
Harding covered the embers of the fire and took from
his teacher's hands whatever she had to carry, going
directly to the Clayton home. She and Kenneth Hastings
were the last to leave. Outside the door, they stood
for a moment, watching the moonlit scene. In the distance,
they heard a man's rich voice singing, "In the
Cross of Christ I glory." They listened. Then they
walked on in silence for some moments, the gaze of each
fixed upon a colossal burning cross through whose yellow
flames violet, and green, and red, and blue leaped
and died away, then leaped again.</p>

<p>"The cross!" he said at last. "How it has gone in
the van of civilization!"</p>

<p>She stopped and laid her hand on his arm. He, too,
stopped and looked questioningly into her lifted face,
which he could see but dimly.</p>

<p>"The world for Christ!" she said, deeply moved.
"It will surely be! Followers of the wonderful Nazarene,
filled and actuated by His spirit of brotherhood, are
reaching the uttermost parts of the earth. We shall live
to see the awakening of nations. We shall live to see
strong men and women enlisted on the side of Christ to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
bring right and justice and purity into life, God into
men's lives."</p>

<p>Again silence.</p>

<p>"I know nothing of God," he responded, "save as I
see power manifested in the physical world. I have read
the Bible so little. I am not intimately familiar with
the life and words of Jesus. Before meeting you, I had
always thought of religion with more or less contempt.
I confess my ignorance. But I am learning
to know <i>you</i>. What you are and what you do convince
me there is something in your religion I have not found.
I am as untaught in spiritual truth as a babe. But
now I want to learn."</p>

<p>"I am glad you do. Will you study your Bible?"</p>

<p>He did not tell her he had no Bible, but he promised
to study one.</p>

<p>"Will you pray too?" she asked, with a little choke
in her voice.</p>

<p>"Would you have me read the prayers of the church?"</p>

<p>"No; the prayer of your own heart."</p>

<p>Then the man became rash.</p>

<p>"The prayer of my heart?" he repeated, with evident
emotion. "The prayer of my heart? That prayer is
that I may win your love, and your hand in marriage.
That is my religion; you, I worship."</p>

<p>"Don't! Don't!" she said, withdrawing her hand
from his arm. "Don't; that seems blasphemous."</p>

<p>"If you could only love me, I might begin to comprehend
what you tell us of the love of God. I love <i>you</i>.
That I <i>know</i>, I understand. You are the embodiment
of all I hold sweet and dear. Can't you love me&mdash;sometime?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," she responded. "What I <i>do</i> know
surely is that I do not love you now. I believe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
love of the deep and abiding kind does not fall at man's
feet as manna, nor does it grow like a mushroom in a
night. It takes time for the mighty, resistless forces of
nature to develop a single blade of grass. So love, I
take it, must have time to grow."</p>

<p>"Then I may hope to win your love?" he said eagerly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; don't think of love. You have my friendship;
let us not spoil the friendship by dreaming of a
love that I cannot give you."</p>

<p>"Do you believe," he asked, "that you will never love
any other man?"</p>

<p>"I believe if such love ever grows in my heart, I
shall walk in glory all my days. It is a sacred thing,
and I could never speak of it lightly, as many do."</p>

<p>"Good night," he said, "and God bless you."</p>

<p>They had reached the Clayton home. The door closed,
and Kenneth was alone. He turned; and before him,
on the foothills, flamed the burning cross.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE ADOPTION OF A MOTHER</h3>

<p class="cap">B<span class="smcap">obbie</span> had become a personality. What is
more, he had adopted Esther Bright as his
mother, without any formalities of the law.
He had found a mother heart, and had taken
his place there by the divine right of love.
No one seemed to know how it had all come about; all
anyone knew, positively, was that Bobbie suddenly began
to call his teacher "Mither."</p>

<p>At first the children laughed when Bobbie would call
her by this new name; then the baby of the school was
broken-hearted, until the teacher had mended the break
with kisses and tender words.</p>

<p>Sometimes at midday recess, the drowsy child would
climb into Esther's lap; and when she would cuddle
him, his great blue eyes would look up into hers with
a look of content and trusting love. After a while the
heavy lids would close, and the flaxen hair lie moist on
the ruddy forehead. Then Bobbie would be laid on
an improvised bed, to finish his siesta.</p>

<p>Day after day went by, with increasing love on
Bobbie's part, and deepening tenderness on the part of
Esther Bright.</p>

<p>He was not always good. Far from it. He was a
healthy little animal, bright and attractive. His activity
sometimes got him into trouble. Then to divert
his mind, his teacher would tell him little stories. When
she would finish, he would say coaxingly, "More."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>After a while, he would call for certain stories she
had already told him, and interrupt her all the way
along, his face alive with intelligent interest. At last
he himself wanted to tell the stories to his teacher, with
many interpolations and funny variations.</p>

<p>But the funniest thing happened one day when he
refused to go home, and announced that he would stay
with his adopted mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Bobbie dear," she said, placing her hand on
his shoulder. "What would your father do without
you?"</p>

<p>"He tan det another wain," he said, in a tone of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"No, Bobbie," insisted the teacher; "you must go
home."</p>

<p>Still he refused. Then all his Scotch stubbornness
asserted itself. He could not be driven or coaxed home.
And when the older children tried to carry him, he
kicked and screamed and fought, till he had freed himself.
He ran to his teacher with heart-rending sobs.
She sent the other children home, and took him in her
arms. Gradually his sobs ceased and he fell asleep.
His face was wet with tears. In his sleep, great sighs,
the aftermath of the storm, seemed to come from his
innermost heart.</p>

<p>The adopted mother sat with her arms clasped about
him. Such a look of tender love came into her face as
one sometimes sees in the face of a young mother, bending
over her sleeping babe. If ever Esther Bright was
beautiful, it was at that moment. Kenneth Hastings
stood a short distance away, watching her. He lifted
his hat and stood with bowed head. At last he spoke
her name. She turned, and nodded toward the sleeping
boy in her arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come sit down," she said, moving to make room for
him on the doorstep.</p>

<p>"You seem to be a good nurse, too," he responded,
taking the proffered seat. "What's Bobbie doing here
this time of day?"</p>

<p>She told him of the child's decision to stay with
her, and his refusal to go home, his fight, and his stormy
sorrow. He listened, with an amused twinkle in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Poor little chap," he said; "he has my sympathy
in refusing to be parted from you."</p>

<p>She flushed slightly.</p>

<p>"Don't waste your sympathy," she replied saucily.
Somehow that provoking smile of his nettled her. He
had found her vulnerable.</p>

<p>"Bigger chaps than he feel the same way towards
you," he said, smiling still.</p>

<p>He saw that she was badly teased, and the spirit of
mischief led him on.</p>

<p>"Now <i>I'd</i> like to stay with you always, myself."</p>

<p>She looked as though she would annihilate him.</p>

<p>"And what is more, I'd like to change places with
Bobbie this very minute."</p>

<p>She rose suddenly, but with some effort, for the child
was stout and heavy for his years.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" he asked, looking admiringly
upon Bobbie.</p>

<p>"I'm going to carry him home."</p>

<p>"How cruel to Bobbie!" he said, stepping near her
and extending his arms for the child. "Let <i>me</i> carry
him, do."</p>

<p>"I can carry him myself, thank you," she said, with
a sudden air of independence.</p>

<p>Again she saw his look of amusement, and struggled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
with her heavy load, knowing full well that she could
not carry him far.</p>

<p>"No, you must not carry him," he said firmly. "He
is too heavy for you." And without more ado, he
took Bobbie from her arms.</p>

<p>"Come," he said amicably, "we'll both take him
home&mdash;to Mrs. Carmichael's."</p>

<p>So on they trudged. Bobbie roused a moment, but
seeing a familiar face, he reached up his grimy hand
and patted the bronzed cheeks, then cuddled comfortably
into the strong arms.</p>

<p>"So Bobbie wanted to stay with you," he was saying.</p>

<p>"Yes, he calls me mither, you know."</p>

<p>"<i>I'd</i> like to call you 'mither' myself some day. It's
a beautiful name."</p>

<p>She felt provoked with herself. Why in the world
had she made that unfortunate remark?</p>

<p>"You love children, don't you?" He was not smiling
now.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; from my childhood up I have loved every
child I have seen."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>But at this juncture Bobbie again roused, rubbed his
eyes and demanded to be put down. So Kenneth set
him on his feet. The little lad stood in sleepy bewilderment
a moment, then with an engaging smile, offered one
hand to Esther, and the other to Kenneth. He began to
chatter.</p>

<p>"Bobbie loves his mither."</p>

<p>"So do I," responded Kenneth.</p>

<p>Esther bit her lip. She would not look up. But
she felt her cheeks flush.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kenneth love Bobbie's mither?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Kenneth laughed, a free, happy laugh. It was contagious,
and the child laughed too. So did Esther in
spite of herself.</p>

<p>"Mr. Kenneth tan't love Bobbie's mither."</p>

<p>"Can't, eh?" Again the happy laugh. "Who says
I can't?"</p>

<p>"I do, his adopted mother," said the girl, demurely.</p>

<p>"I'll just capture you the way Bobbie did, and you
can't help yourself." And again the stern eyes that
seldom smiled, were filled with laughter.</p>

<p>Esther suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> can take Bobbie home."</p>

<p>"So can I," he said carelessly, with a suggestion of
laughter still in his voice.</p>

<p>"I command you, Mr. Persistency, to turn about and
leave me to take Bobbie home."</p>

<p>"I refuse to obey, Miss Obstinacy." A low chuckle.</p>

<p>"I suppose I'll have to endure you, then," she said,
with mock seriousness.</p>

<p>"I suppose you will," he said. He seemed to enjoy
the tilt. "But Miss Bright&mdash;." He stood still and
faced her. "&mdash;I didn't know you were such a fighter.
Here I have been trying to make you understand how I
appreciate you, and you almost give me a black eye."</p>

<p>"You had two before&mdash;ever you saw me," she said.</p>

<p>"You have looked into them, then," he said, maliciously,
"so that you know their color?"</p>

<p>He was, provokingly confident in his manner. Suddenly
she stopped again. They were almost at Mrs.
Carmichael's door, and Robert Duncan's shack was not
far away.</p>

<p>"Really, Mr Hastings," she said, resuming a serious
tone, "I do wish you would leave me."</p>

<p>"No," he persisted, "I am going to see you safely
home."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Carmichael met them at the door. Donald had
already reached home, and had told her of Bobbie's
refusal to return with him. She patted the little one
on the head. He was an attractive little boy, and it
was evident Mrs. Carmichael loved him. She stooped
and extended her arms, and the child ran into them.</p>

<p>"So my Bobbie was nae coming home tae his auntie?
What'd I dae wi'oot him?"</p>

<p>Bobbie hung his head and then said softly:</p>

<p>"Bobbie hae found a mither."</p>

<p>The call was prolonged in order to get Bobbie into
a staying frame of mind. At last they spied Robert
Duncan approaching his shack, when Kenneth stepped
over to tell him of Bobbie's decision and afternoon experience.
At first the man smiled, then the tears
trickled down his face.</p>

<p>"Puir bairn, puir bairn," he said, huskily. Kenneth
laid a kindly hand on his shoulder. He knew that Duncan
was disheartened, and had spent much time, lately,
in the saloons.</p>

<p>"Come," he said. "Come get the little chap. It is
evident he misses his mother."</p>

<p>"Yes, he misses her, an' I miss her. I'll gie mair
time tae him."</p>

<p>So saying, he accompanied Kenneth to the Carmichael
home and soon Bobbie was in his father's arms.</p>

<p>The call of Kenneth and Esther drew to a close.</p>

<p>As the two walked briskly toward the camp, Esther
Bright paused from time to time to draw in great
breaths of air, and to drink in the glory of the world
about her.</p>

<p>"Come," her companion said, "we shall be late to
dinner. Did you know I am invited to dine with the
Claytons to-night?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Really!" She tossed back the curls the stiff breeze
had blown across her eyes.</p>

<p>"Really!" he echoed, in a tone of mockery. "Miss
Bright, pardon me, but you&mdash;" He paused.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said. "What about <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>"You look altogether charming."</p>

<p>She stopped. He walked on.</p>

<p>"You are perfectly incorrigible," she called. "Unless
you promise to talk sense, I'll not go a step further
with you."</p>

<p>He turned.</p>

<p>"Sense?" he said with mock seriousness, "that's
what I have been talking when in your society all these
weeks past. And here you make me play second fiddle
to Jack Harding, Wathemah and Bobbie."</p>

<p>"And you prefer to be <i>first</i> fiddle?"</p>

<p>"Of course!"</p>

<p>She seemed in high spirits, ready for a tilt.</p>

<p>"Do be sensible," she said gayly.</p>

<p>"Sensible? I was never more sensible in my life."
He made a long face.</p>

<p>"Unfortunate man!" She sighed, as though his condition
were utterly hopeless.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Miss Bright!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Hastings!"</p>

<p>"I have been thinking!"</p>

<p>"Marvelous!" She seemed like some mocking sprite.</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask what I am thinking about?"
He seemed provokingly cool.</p>

<p>"Because you are just dying to tell me." She was
piquant.</p>

<p>"I vow I'm not. I won't tell you!"</p>

<p>"All right," she returned, quickening her pace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Really, now, <i>don't</i> you wish to know what I have
been thinking about?" He stepped nearer to her.</p>

<p>"I'm not the least bit concerned," she answered with
airy indifference. "I wouldn't know for anything."</p>

<p>"Then I'll tell you. I was just thinking what fun
it would be to meet you in society, and have a rattling
flirtation with you."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" She lifted her head. "You'd find Greek
had met Greek."</p>

<p>"I've no doubt. That would be the fun of it."</p>

<p>"And you might die of a broken heart." Her tone
was full of laughter.</p>

<p>"That's what I'm doing already." He looked comical.
"And you take no pity on me."</p>

<p>"You might take a dose of soothing syrup." She
looked extremely solicitous.</p>

<p>"How extremely kind of you, Miss Bright. But my
malady is in the region of the heart. I suspect you think
I haven't a heart. But really, Miss Skeptic, a heart
happens to be a part of my anatomy."</p>

<p>"I thought we were to talk sense," she reminded
him.</p>

<p>Just then they heard a familiar call, and turning, saw
Lord Kelwin hastening towards them.</p>

<p>"By George!" he said, breathing hard. "I have been
trying to overtake you two for a half mile. You seemed
to be having a mighty good time."</p>

<p>"Good time?" echoed Kenneth. "Miss Bright has
been abusing me all the way." He assumed an injured
air.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt, Miss Bright, that Mr. Kenneth
enjoyed the treatment he received," remarked Lord
Kelwin.</p>

<p>"Enjoyed it?" Kenneth interjected. "I have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
a perfect martyr to feminine cruelty. And would you
believe it? Miss Bright has been trying to palm off
on me that she is not a daughter of Eve."</p>

<p>"You are a veritable son of Adam," she rejoined,
gayly. "And to think that I shall have to endure you
at dinner!"</p>

<p>"You'll have to endure another son of Adam, too,"
interjected Lord Kelwin, "for I am invited also."</p>

<p>At once new light broke in upon Esther.</p>

<p>"I believe you are letting the cat out of the bag,"
she said, "for I am sure this is intended to be a surprise
for me. I have a birthday to-day."</p>

<p>"A birthday?" Kenneth said. "Let me see&mdash;"
he said with comic gravity,"&mdash;you are getting to be a
venerable lady. I presume you'll never see fifty
again?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I assure you that is altogether too young."
Then she turned to Lord Kelwin.</p>

<p>"Do you think it proper to suggest such frivolity as a
flirtation to one of my advanced years?"</p>

<p>"Highly improper. Highly improper," said the
Irishman, "but I'd like a hand in such a flirtation
myself." He seemed to enjoy the nonsense.</p>

<p>"Then there would be two victims."</p>

<p>"You and I?" questioned Lord Kelwin.</p>

<p>"No; you and Mr. Kenneth."</p>

<p>"I was just thinking&mdash;." Lord Kelwin paused, to
think of something that would make him a score.</p>

<p>"Thinking! Thinking!" as though that were quite
incomprehensible. "Mr. Hastings also claimed to be
thinking."</p>

<p>"Better leave her alone, Kelwin," laughed Kenneth.
"She will have the last word. She's like the woman
with the scissors."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good avenin'," said a rich brogue just at hand.</p>

<p>"How are you, Patrick?" said Kenneth.</p>

<p>"Well, sir. How are yez, Miss?" He gave his
slouch hat a jerk. "Good avenin', Lord Kelwin."</p>

<p>They walked on together, and the talk drifted to the
Gila Club.</p>

<p>"I'm really surprised, don't you know," said Lord
Kelwin, "at the interest these fellows take in the club."</p>

<p>"It's the first dacint thing the byes has had ter go
to. Look at that saloon there!" he said, pointing to
an overgrown shack, where women of the coarsest type
presided. "And look at that opium den," he said, indicating
a small building at their right. "And see that
haythen," he said, pointing to a female who stood in
the door of a saloon, her cheeks painted, and puffing
away at a cigarette. "Thim is the things as has sint the
byes to desthruction."</p>

<p>Kenneth Hastings and Lord Kelwin made no reply.</p>

<p>"If yez kape on, schoolma'am," continued Patrick,
"yez'll wipe out the saloons and opium places, an'
make dacint min an' women out of these poor crathers."
He nodded his head.</p>

<p>"So pitifully sad!" Esther's vivacious mood suddenly
vanished. She was again grave and thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Aye," said Patrick, "but yez kin do it, Miss, niver
yez doubt it. Yez can do it! Oi used ter go ter the
saloon mesilf, but Oi'll go no more, no more. That's
what yez has done fur me."</p>

<p>Just then Wathemah came running and leaping from
Keith's saloon. In a moment he spied them, and ran
full tilt towards them.</p>

<p>"It makes me sick at heart," Esther said in a low
tone to Patrick, "whenever I think of Wathemah living
longer in the saloon."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yez air right, Miss," answered Patrick, "but Misthress
Keith is a purty dacint sort av a woman, and she
has been good ter the lad."</p>

<p>"Yes, I realize that. But I wish I could take him
myself."</p>

<p>By this time the child was trudging along beside his
Beloved.</p>

<p>Lord Kelwin liked to tease him, and said in a bantering
tone, "What are you always hanging on to Miss
Bright's hand for, Wathemah? She don't allow the
rest of her admirers to do that."</p>

<p>Wathemah placed his other hand over the hand he
clasped.</p>

<p>"<i>Me</i> teacher <i>mine</i>!" he said, defiantly.</p>

<p>The men laughed. The teacher placed one hand on
the child's head. He rested his cheek against her hand,
as he said softly, "Me <i>mother</i>."</p>

<p>"Your mother, eh?" Lord Kelwin looked amused.
"I wish she'd mother the rest of us."</p>

<p>The child did not understand the laughter, and fancying
himself ridiculed by Lord Kelwin, turned, ran and
leaped like a squirrel to his shoulder, and struck him
in the face.</p>

<p>"You little savage," the Irishman said, angrily, as
he grasped the child and shook him.</p>

<p>"Let <i>me</i> settle with Wathemah," said Esther, firmly.
She stepped forward, and took him by the arm, and
held him. "Go on," she said to the men, "I will
follow."</p>

<p>They sauntered on, leaving her with the refractory
urchin. When she and the child finally overtook them,
Wathemah's face was tear-stained.</p>

<p>Nothing more was said to the child until they reached
the Clayton door.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess you had better go back now, dear," Esther
said, placing her hand on Wathemah's shoulder.</p>

<p>"No," he said stoutly, "Mrs. Clayton ask Wathemah
he Miss Bright party."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she said, with sudden understanding, "you
came to celebrate my birthday, didn't you?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"You want me to wash your face and hands, don't
you, Wathemah?" she asked. And off she went with
the child.</p>

<p>"By George," said Lord Kelwin, "I never saw such
a woman."</p>

<p>"Nor I," returned Kenneth. "There is no other
like her."</p>

<p>The other whistled, and Kenneth flushed. His companion
went on, "I'd like to know if she really has
a fortune."</p>

<p>"Better ask her." Lord Kelwin did not observe the
look of contempt on Kenneth's face.</p>

<p>But host and hostess had entered the spacious
room, and were extending gracious welcomes.</p>

<p>"Does either of you happen to know of the whereabouts
of Miss Bright?" questioned Mr. Clayton.</p>

<p>On learning of her arrival with them, he rallied them
on spiriting her off. In the midst of the raillery,
Esther and Wathemah entered the room. The latter
found his way at once to Mr. Clayton's side, for they
were great friends. The entrance of Esther was the
signal for further badinage.</p>

<p>"John, what do you think of a young lady who tells
her escort she supposes she'll have to endure him?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Clayton," she said, with a saucy tilt of her
head, "what do you think of gentlemen who tell a lady
they would like to flirt with her?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>"That depends," he answered, with a broad smile,
"upon who the lady is. Now if I were not a staid
married man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You do not answer my question," she said. "You
introduce an altogether extraneous matter. I asked you
what you thought of gentlemen who would tell a lady
they would like to flirt with her." Here both Lord
Kelwin and Kenneth Hastings tried to present their
cases. Esther raised her hand. "Would you not consider
this great frivolity, Mr. Clayton?" And she assumed
a prim, shocked expression so funny that all
laughed.</p>

<p>"If you wish to know my candid opinion," he said,
with the air of a judge, "I believe they were within
the law; but, if they were guilty offenders, they have
my sympathy."</p>

<p>Wathemah looked from one to another with a puzzled
expression as he listened to their laughter. He seemed
to sense the fact that his Beloved was in some way the
butt of their fun. In a moment he had slid from his
place on John Clayton's knee, and was standing leaning
against Esther.</p>

<p>"That's right, Wathemah," she said, pretending to
be greatly injured, "you take my part."</p>

<p>"Look out here, young man," said Lord Kelwin, as
Wathemah approached him with a threatening fist.
Kenneth caught the child, and held him close in his
arms, whispering to him, "We're only fooling, Wathemah."</p>

<p>But he said aloud:</p>

<p>"Did you know, John, that Miss Bright has become
an adopted mother?"</p>

<p>"No. Whom has she adopted? You?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
"Me? No. That's a good one. She's adopted Duncan's
little boy, Bobbie. And when I suggested that I'd
like to change places with Bobbie, she almost annihilated
me."</p>

<p>All seemed to be enjoying the nonsense.</p>

<p>"Really, Miss Bright," continued Lord Kelwin, "I
think you should be at the head of an orphanage."</p>

<p>"I suppose you'd like to be chief orphan," suggested
John Clayton.</p>

<p>Then the talk drifted to serious themes, until dinner
was announced. A birthday cake with sixteen lighted
candles, in the center of the table, was the signal for
another fusillade of fun.</p>

<p>"Sixteen! sixteen!" said Kenneth Hastings. "I accused
Miss Bright, to-day, of being fifty, and she assured
me she was not so young as that."</p>

<p>"Sixteen! sweet sixteen!" said Lord Kelwin, bowing
low.</p>

<p>She, in turn, bowed <i>her</i> head.</p>

<p>"You see," she said, "our good prophet, Mrs. Clayton,
cried out, and the shadow has turned backward
on the dial of Ahaz."</p>

<p>"It is not so much the number of years we count on
the dial, after all," spoke Mrs. Clayton, who had thus
far listened smilingly to the others; "it is what we live
into those years. And you have lived already a long
life in your few years, dear friend."</p>

<p>"You are right," Kenneth rejoined. "Miss Bright
has lived more years of service to her fellow men in the
few months she has been in Gila, than I have lived in my
thirty years." Then, half in jest, half in earnest, he
continued, "I wish Miss Bright could have been my
grandmother, then my mother, then my&mdash;" He halted
in embarrassment, as he saw a deep blush sweep over
Esther's face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"And then&mdash;" suggested Lord Kelwin, in a provoking
tone&mdash;"and then?"</p>

<p>"I should like her for my <i>friend</i>."</p>

<p>"So say we all of us," rejoined John Clayton. Then
observing Esther's face, he changed the drift of the conversation.</p>

<p>"How would you good people like to make up a party
to go to Box Canyon sometime in the near future?"</p>

<p>"Delightful!" spoke several, simultaneously. And
thereupon they began to describe for Esther the canyon
and what she would see.</p>

<p>Before leaving the table, every wineglass save one
was filled with sherry. That glass was turned down.
John Clayton rose and lifted his glass.</p>

<p>"Here's to our dear friend, Miss Bright. May she
always be sixteen at heart, with her ideals of life as
true and as sweet as they are now; may the cares of life
sit lightly upon her; may she be given strength to do
all that she will always seek out and find to do; may
the love of the true of heart enfold her; may the
Heavenly Father keep her in all her ways; may the
shadow ever turn backward on the dial."</p>

<p>And lifting their glasses, they drank to this toast.</p>

<p>Ah, little did they realize how prophetic in some ways
that toast would prove to be, nor how great was the work
that lay before the lovely and fragile-looking girl.
All were happy and light-hearted; at least, all save
Carla Earle. She sat quiet and retiring, when her
duties were over. Wathemah had found refuge in her
lap, and his regular breathing assured her he was fast
asleep. So the evening wore on. At last all the guests
except Wathemah had departed. The fire burned low.
And soon all were asleep in the quiet house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>THE GREAT TRANSFORMATION</h3>

<p class="cap">J<span class="smcap">ohn</span> Harding seemed a new man. If ever
man fought desperately the evil in his nature,
he did. It would be foolish to say that he became
a saint. Far from it. He was at all
times very human.</p>

<p>All the years of his life, his deeper nature had been
lying fallow. No one had ever cared enough about
him to suspect or discover its richness. Now some one
had found him who did care, and who knew instinctively
what lay below the forbidding exterior.</p>

<p>He sought Esther Bright with all sorts of questions,
many of them questions a child might have asked (for he
was but a child as yet in knowledge of many things);
and she poured out the richness of her own knowledge,
the inspiration of her transcendent faith, until the man
roused from a long sleep, and began to grapple with
great questions of life. He read, he thought, and he
questioned.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when long away from Esther's influence,
he yielded to the temptations of the saloon again, and
drank heavily. On one of these occasions, he chanced
to cross her path as he came staggering from a saloon.
He tried to avoid her, but failed.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack," she said, laying her hand on his arm,
"is this what Jesus would have you do? Come home."</p>

<p>"'Taint no use," he answered, in a drunken drawl,
"no use. I ain't nobody; never was nobody. Let me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
be, I say. Nobody cares a blank for me." He threw
an arm out impatiently.</p>

<p>"'Sh!" she interrupted. "Jesus cares. Mr. and Mrs.
Clayton care. I care. Miss Edith cares. Come home
with me, John."</p>

<p>So saying, she led him on to the Clayton ranch.</p>

<p>After a field has lain fallow many years, it must be
turned and overturned again, in order to yield an
abundant harvest. So it is with a soul.</p>

<p>John Harding's soul was slowly but surely being
prepared to receive the seeds of truth. There were days
when it seemed as though a demon possessed him. Then
he would mysteriously disappear, and be gone for days.
He always returned worn and haggard, but gentle.
Then he would seek Esther Bright, and say simply:</p>

<p>"I have conquered!"</p>

<p>He seemed to know intuitively that she never lost
faith in him. He felt certain that he would yet become
what she wished him to be,&mdash;a true man. And this
conviction made every battle with himself less terrible.
At last he knew that the good in him was master.</p>

<p>All this did not come about at once. Months passed
before he knew that he could feel sure of his victory.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the church service had become established
in Gila. Esther Bright preached with deepening
spiritual power. The cowlasses now attended
regularly. Other women, too, had come. Miners, dirt
begrimed, had astonished their cronies by coming to
hear the teacher talk. Even men from the charcoal pits
and burro camps found their way to the crowded room.</p>

<p>One Sunday, the atmosphere of the meeting was so
remarkable it still stands out in the memory of many
a Gilaite of those early days.</p>

<p>Esther Bright had preached on the Healing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Lepers. She had told them of the disease of leprosy,
its loathsomeness, its hopelessness. Then she vividly
pictured the ten lepers, the approach of Christ, and
their marvelous restoration. She showed them sin, its
power to degrade men and women, and to weaken the
will. She urged the need of God's help, and the necessity
for each one to put forth his will power. Her low,
earnest, heart-searching voice seemed to move many in
that audience. Again and again rough hands brushed
away tears they were ashamed for others to see. Ah,
could there be help for them! Could there!</p>

<p>The speaker seemed filled with a power outside of
herself, a power that was appealing to the consciences of
men.</p>

<p>Kenneth Hastings, caught in this great spiritual tide,
was swept from his moorings, out, out, on and away
from self, Godward. He rose and spoke with deep feeling.
Then some one sang the first stanza of "Where are
the Nine?" The singing ceased. The Spirit of God
seemed brooding over all. The pregnant silence was
followed by a succession of marvels. A Scotch miner
rose and said:</p>

<p>"I am a sinner. Jesus, Maister, hae mercy on <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>Then voice after voice was heard confessing sin and
praying for mercy.</p>

<p>At the close of the service, there were many touching
scenes as men and women long hardened and burdened,
came to this young girl for words of hope and
encouragement.</p>

<p>If ever human being was an instrument in the hands
of God, Esther Bright was that day.</p>

<p>The attendance at the meetings increased so that the
schoolhouse could no longer accommodate the people. It
was still too cool to hold out-of-door meetings. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
midst of Esther's perplexity, she received a call from
one of the saloon keepers.</p>

<p>"I 'ave been attending the meetings," he said, "and
see that you need a larger room. I 'ave come to offer
you my saloon."</p>

<p>"Your saloon, Mr. Keith?" she said, aghast.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "my saloon! I'm one of the lepers
ye told about the other day. I 'ave decided to give
up the saloon business."</p>

<p>This was beyond Esther's wildest dreams.</p>

<p>"You have decided to give up the saloon?" she said,
overjoyed. "I am so glad! But how will you make
your living?"</p>

<p>"I'll go to minin' again, an' my wife'll keep boarders.
She's glad to 'ave me give up the dram shop."</p>

<p>Esther's eyes filled with happy tears.</p>

<p>The first Sunday in February had arrived. Nearly
all vestiges of a saloon had disappeared from what had
been Keith's saloon. Masses of mistletoe and fragrant
spruce had taken the place of indecent pictures. A
cabinet organ, borrowed for the occasion, stood at one
side. A small table served as the speaker's desk. The
billiard tables had disappeared, and chairs now filled
the room.</p>

<p>The crowd that gathered about the door the day
of this first service in the saloon was unusually large,
for word had gone out that David Bright, the grandfather
of their pastor, would speak at the meeting.</p>

<p>The saving of the souls of men had come to be the
vital question of the hour in Gila.</p>

<p>As the crowd caught sight of a stately white-haired
man accompanying their leader, there was a respectful
hush. Men and women stepped aside, leaving a
passage to the door. The two entered. The singers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
were already in their places. The congregation assembled,
and the song service began. At its close, there
followed an impressive stillness, broken only by the
joyous notes of a Kentucky cardinal.</p>

<p>The aged preacher sat with bowed head. One would
hardly have been surprised to hear a voice from on high.</p>

<p>At last he rose. Everyone looked intently into his
benevolent, kindly face. Slowly and impressively he
repeated:</p>

<p>"Repent ye; for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand."</p>

<p>He repeated the words a second time, then took
his seat.</p>

<p>Again the pregnant silence. When David Bright
rose the second time, he read Matthew III., and closing
his Bible spoke to them for an hour, holding their undivided
attention.</p>

<p>"Beloved," he said, "this voice is speaking to us to-day.
'Repent ye: for the kingdom of Heaven is at
hand.' The kingdom comes to us individually. It
comes only as men's hearts are prepared for it."</p>

<p>Then he carried his audience with him as he preached
the need of repentance, and Christ's compassionate love
for every human soul. His voice rose and fell, and the
roughest men listened, while down many faces flowed
repentant tears. Oh miracle of miracles,&mdash;the turning
from sin to righteousness! Oh greatest experience
of the human heart,&mdash;the entrance of the Divine!</p>

<p>As the godly man took his seat, Esther Bright rose,
and sang, with face shining, "I Love to Tell the Story."
As she sang, the notes of the Kentucky cardinal burst
forth, a joyous accompaniment to her glad song.</p>

<p>To the amazement of all, Ben Keith rose and said:</p>

<p>"I 'ave been a sinful man. May God forgive me. I
repent me of my sins. I 'ave led men and women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
astray in this saloon. May God forgive me. I 'ave
determined to turn face about, and to lead an honest life.
I 'ave sold my last drop o' whiskey. I 'ave poured all
I 'ad left on the ground. I shall keep no more saloon.
May God 'ave mercy on my soul, and on the souls of
them as I 'ave led astray."</p>

<p>A sob was heard. It came from the long-suffering
Mrs. Keith. Then another stood, asking for prayers;
then another, then another. Last of all, David Bright
rose, and after speaking a few fatherly encouraging
words, he dismissed them with the benediction.</p>

<p>He was soon surrounded by men waiting for a word,
a hand grasp. They asked for personal conferences
with him.</p>

<p>"Let us go down to the timber," suggested Jack
Harding. So together these men strolled down to the
river bank.</p>

<p>"Thou art troubled about the unpardonable sin, thou
sayest?" the preacher said to a young man walking
by his side.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the youth addressed. "I've been a
bad one, but now I really want to be a Christian. I
fear I have committed the unpardonable sin. Do you
suppose&mdash;" he asked in a voice that choked a little,
"that God could pardon such a sinner as I am?"</p>

<p>"With God all things are possible," reverently replied
the other, laying a kindly hand on the young
man's shoulder. "The only sin that seems to me to be
unpardonable is that unrighteous obstinacy that forever
refuses the <i>offer</i> of salvation."</p>

<p>And into the old man's face came an expression of
sorrow.</p>

<p>"But if the offer of salvation is forever <i>passed by</i>,
what then?" asked another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"I believe the soul is lost."</p>

<p>"You mean the soul is in a place of fire and torment,
literal hell fire?" asked the first speaker.</p>

<p>"I said I believe the soul is lost."</p>

<p>"Then you don't believe in hell?" asked another.</p>

<p>"No," answered David Bright; "not as some believe
in it,&mdash;literal fire. Spirit or soul is, I believe, immortal.
It lives on. To know God, and Jesus Christ, His Son, is eternal life; not to know them is death. To
obey the laws of God here on earth means a foretaste
of heaven; to disobey them, means a foretaste of hell."</p>

<p>"And you think there can be hell on earth?" asked
one.</p>

<p>"Yes: a man's own evil mind and life make for him
a constant hell."</p>

<p>"And you believe heaven may begin on earth?"</p>

<p>"I do. Heaven is the rightful heritage of the soul.
Heaven is accord with the Divine. It is the natural
environment of the soul. It is more natural to do right
than wrong. It is evil environment that perverts the
soul."</p>

<p>They seated themselves on a dead tree trunk.</p>

<p>"Here," said David Bright, laying his hand on the
fallen tree, "you see an illustration of what happens
to many a life. Its environment has brought a parasite
that lays hold upon the life of the tree, saps its
strength, and decay follows. Destructive agencies in a
sinful environment lay hold of human life, sap its
strength, and moral decay follows. Many a strong man
has fallen as has this magnificent tree. Nothing can
revitalize the tree once fallen into decay; but, thanks
be to God, there <i>is</i> a force that can revitalize the human
being long after he seems dead and lost to the world,
and that is the redemptive power of Jesus Christ. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
is no other name under heaven given among men
whereby we must be saved."</p>

<p>The look of one who bears the sorrow of his race
upon his heart came into the beautiful face. And the
men watched him with deepening reverence for their
kind.</p>

<p>One who had thus far been silent spoke.</p>

<p>"But if the soul is immortal, spiritual death cannot
come."</p>

<p>The old man looked keenly into the young man's
eyes. He spoke with deepest conviction as he said:</p>

<p>"I believe there is almost no limit to the possibilities
of the mind and soul to him whose ideals are high,
whose courage is great, and who holds himself to the
very highest ideals of living. Christ paved the way
for such a life for every young man. That sort of life
is real living, for it means constructive work in the world.
It means growth, immortality.</p>

<p>"To come short of what one might be, steadily, increasingly,
brings moral deterioration, atrophy;&mdash;to my
mind, the saddest form of death. It is life to grow toward
the Divine. My son, it will soon be too late. Turn
Godward now. Shall we pray?"</p>

<p>Then up to the throne of God went a prayer for these
young men,&mdash;sons of parents who had long ago lost their
grip on them.</p>

<p>For about two weeks, religious meetings were held
daily. Night after night the room was crowded. The
services consisted of talks by David Bright, songs, short
prayers and testimony. Sometimes several men and
women would be on their feet at once, eager to voice
their repentance, and to testify of God's mercy.</p>

<p>The interest did not end here. Down in the mines,
brief meetings were held daily at the noon hour. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
group of miners would start a hymn; then way off,
another group would catch up the refrain. On many
lips the oath or unclean story died unspoken.</p>

<p>Men sought David Bright as they would a father confessor,
pouring the story of their lives into his kind and
sympathetic ear. They seemed to know intuitively that
he was a man of God. What mattered, if he were
Catholic or Protestant? He found men evil, and left
them good.</p>

<p>And Esther Bright's influence was hardly less marked.
Her deep spirituality made her a great power for righteousness.</p>

<p>John Harding seemed scarcely less interested in saving
men's souls than she. "Giving men a chance," he
called it. He went from mining camp to mining camp,
carrying the tidings of salvation, and urging men to
repent. And those who heard him not only came to the
meetings, but began to bring others also. And so the
work grew.</p>

<p>It was at the close of David Bright's second week in
Gila that the most impressive meeting was held. At
its close, the aged evangelist bade them farewell. Then
they crowded about him, thanking him for all he had
done for them, and asking him to remember them in
his prayers.</p>

<p>Kenneth Hastings was the last to speak with him. He
asked for a personal interview. Then arm in arm, they
strolled up the mountain road.</p>

<p>What was said during that interview no one ever
knew. But when the two returned to Clayton Ranch,
David Bright walked with his hand resting on the young
man's shoulder. Esther heard her grandfather say
to him:</p>

<p>"I honor thee for it, my son. I believe under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
same circumstances, I should feel as thou dost. It is
a serious question."</p>

<p>Kenneth said something in reply that did not reach
Esther's ears. She heard her grandfather speaking
again:</p>

<p>"Yes, she is an unusual woman, as thou sayest. She
has always been a delightful character, and Christlike
in her purity. She is compassionate and loving because
she has always walked in the Master's steps."</p>

<p>The two men entered the house, and John Clayton
advanced to greet them.</p>

<p>"That was a great meeting," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," David Bright replied, "God has touched the
hearts of the people."</p>

<p>He sat down by his granddaughter, put his arm about
her, and drew her to him.</p>

<p>"The field is white unto the harvest, Beloved," he
said, looking into her upturned face.</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of the harvest yet, Grandfather,"
she said simply. "We have been getting the soil ready
to sow good seed at every opportunity. We are on
the verge of the growing time."</p>

<p>"Well, well, as you will, little philosopher," he said,
releasing her.</p>

<p>It was a lovely picture to see the two side by side.
The white head of the one suggested a life work near
completion; while the golden brown of the other, suggested
life's work at its beginning. Happy would it
be if godly and beautiful age could give up its unfinished
tasks to those who are content to prepare the
soil, and sow good seed, intent on the growing time!</p>

<p>The social hours in the Clayton home that day were
ones to be long remembered. David Bright was a man
enriched from many sources. He gave himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
his companions in intercourse as rare as it was beautiful.
Conversation had never become to him a lost art;
it was the flowering out of the life within.</p>

<p>And Kenneth Hastings listened. If <i>he</i> had only had
such a father! He was beginning to see it all now,&mdash;life's
great possibility.</p>

<p>At last he was drawn into the conversation.</p>

<p>"I hardly know," he responded to a question from
David Bright. How many things he now realized he
"hardly knew!" How vague a notion he had, anyhow,
of many questions affecting the destiny of the human
race! He thought aloud:</p>

<p>"You see Mr. Bright, I was reared in a worldly home,
and I was brought up in the Church of England. My
religion is simply a beautiful ritual. But, further than
that, I know nothing about it. I never felt any interest
in religion until&mdash;" here his face flushed "&mdash;until your
granddaughter came. She found me a heathen&mdash;"
He hesitated, and glancing toward Esther, caught her
glance. How lovely she was! As he hesitated, David
Bright finished his sentence, smiling genially as he did
so.</p>

<p>"And made you a Christian, I hope."</p>

<p>"I fear not. I am plagued with doubts."</p>

<p>"You will conquer the doubts," responded David
Bright, "and be stronger for the struggle. Triumphant
faith is worth battling for."</p>

<p>"Well," said Kenneth, "I feel that I am adrift on
a great sea. If anyone pilots me to a safe harbor, it
will be your granddaughter."</p>

<p>"No," she said, looking into his face with a sudden
radiance in her own, "but the Man of Galilee."</p>

<p>And so the talk drifted, talk where each one could
be himself and speak out of his innermost heart, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
be misunderstood. So blessed is friendship of the higher
sort.</p>

<p>The day passed and the morrow dawned. Then David
Bright journeyed eastward again, to minister to the
world's unfortunate ones.</p>

<p>He left behind him in Gila an influence that men
speak of to this day. But to no one, probably, did his
coming mean more than to John Harding. John's
transformation was now complete. He became the self-appointed
evangelist to numbers of unfortunate and
tempted men. He had risen in the scale of life, and
had become a Man!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>SOME SOCIAL EXPERIENCES</h3>

<p class="cap">O<span class="smcap">ne</span> evening about the middle of February,
Kenneth Hastings called at the Clayton
home. After a few moments of general
conversation, he turned to Mrs. Clayton
and begged to be excused from his engagement
to accompany them to Box Canyon.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Kenneth," protested Edith.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Edith," he said, turning to her, "but
I leave to-morrow for England."</p>

<p>"For England!" ejaculated Esther in astonishment;
for she knew that a visit to England had been remote
from his thoughts the last time she had talked with him.</p>

<p>"Nothing wrong at home, I hope, Kenneth?" said
John Clayton, kindly.</p>

<p>"My uncle cabled me that my parents were killed in
an accident. It is imperative that I go at once."</p>

<p>He paused. John Clayton reached over and laid a
hand on his arm. Mrs. Clayton spoke a few words of
sympathy; but Esther Bright sat silent. How she had
urged him to make his parents a visit! How he had
rebuffed her, saying they cared nothing for him! She
remembered his saying that he had always been starved
for a mother's love. Too late now to give or to receive.</p>

<p>She felt Kenneth looking at her, expecting her to say
some word. She seemed suddenly dumb. At last she
heard him speak her name. He hesitated, then continued:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish I had gone when you suggested it, Miss
Bright."</p>

<p>He bowed his head upon his hand.</p>

<p>"I wish you <i>had</i> gone," she said, simply. "It might
have been a comfort to you."</p>

<p>After awhile he spoke cheerfully of his return, and
of what they would do.</p>

<p>"Don't let Miss Bright work too hard," he said, smiling
gravely. "She does enough work for five men."</p>

<p>"I shall miss your help," was all she said. But she
felt a sudden longing to comfort him. Into her face
flashed a look of sympathy. He knew it was for him.</p>

<p>"It almost makes me homesick, Kenneth, to hear you
talk of going home," said Mrs. Clayton. "England
always will seem home to me," she added, turning to
Esther.</p>

<p>"It is a beautiful country to call home," responded
the New England girl. "I love England."</p>

<p>They talked till late, Kenneth receiving message after
message from them to kindred and friends across the
sea.</p>

<p>He rose to go, taking leave of Esther last of all.
Then he turned to her with both hands extended. She
placed her own in his. He drew her towards him, and
without a word, turned and was gone.</p>

<p>Esther withdrew, and Edith and Carla soon followed,
leaving John Clayton and his wife seated before the fireplace.</p>

<p>"Well, John!" said the wife.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear?" responded the husband, apparently
surmising what was coming.</p>

<p>"Kenneth <i>loves</i> Miss Bright."</p>

<p>"Well, is this the first time you have suspected that?"
As though he had always suspected it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"No! But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"Is he worthy of her, John?"</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish, Mary. Kenneth is a true and
honorable man. Yes&mdash;" pausing to listen to her expostulations,&mdash;"I
know he used to drink some; but I
never saw him intoxicated. He played cards as we do
here, and when he was in the company of men who
gambled, he gambled too."</p>

<p>"But morally, John. It's goodness that a woman
cares most about. Is he all right morally?"</p>

<p>He drew his chair close to hers.</p>

<p>"I believe Kenneth to be clean morally. If he had
been immoral here, I should have known of it. And yet
he, like the other men, has been surrounded by temptation.
What is gross does not appeal to him. I have
never known him to speak lightly of any woman. For
you and Edith he has the deepest respect; for Carla, he
has the utmost compassion; and for Miss Bright, (bless
her!) he has a reverence I have never seen any man show
to any woman."</p>

<p>"Then he loves her, doesn't he?"</p>

<p>"He never told me so," he answered, smiling; "I
doubt if he has told her."</p>

<p>"But after that good-by to-night," she persisted, "I
<i>know</i> he loves her."</p>

<p>"I hope he does, Mary, and that she cares for him.
I don't see how she could help it. I'd like to see them
happy,&mdash;as happy as you and I are, Mary."</p>

<p>He leaned toward her, resting his cheek against hers.</p>

<p>"As happy as we are, Beloved. Twenty years
married. Am I right? And lovers still."</p>

<p>"Yes, twenty happy years," she said, "twenty happy
years. But, John, do you think Miss Bright would make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Kenneth happy? Would she give up her philanthropic
ideas to devote herself to one ordinary man?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's what's troubling you now, is it?" he
asked, laughing outright. Then he spoke seriously:</p>

<p>"I believe Miss Bright could and would make Kenneth
supremely happy. You know she is domestic in
her tastes, and I believe home would always be her first
consideration. But she is such a broad, public spirited
woman she would always be a public benefactor. And
Kenneth is not an ordinary man. You know that well.
He is superior. I do not know of any man for whom I
have such a strong friendship."</p>

<p>"I like Kenneth, too," she admitted. "But I was
just thinking."</p>

<p>He rose and covered the embers for the night.</p>

<p>"Better leave them alone," he suggested. "Their
story is so beautiful I'd not like to have it spoiled."</p>

<p>"John!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mary."</p>

<p>"I just thought of something!"</p>

<p>"Remarkable! What did you think of?"</p>

<p>"Kenneth will inherit a large fortune, won't he?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"That might change his plans."</p>

<p>"I think not. He loves America, and the woman he
loves is here. He will return. Come! Let's to sleep."</p>

<p>The going of Kenneth Hastings brought a shadow
over the household. His departure was likewise the
signal for frequent calls from Lord Kelwin. It grew
more apparent that he felt a marked interest in the
teacher. But whether she felt a corresponding interest
in him, no one could have determined. A few times
she went horseback riding with him. He assured her
she was becoming an excellent horsewoman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Kelwin now became a constant attendant at the
meetings of the club, on all of which occasions he was
Esther's self-appointed escort.</p>

<p>Once he ventured a remark about how it happened
that a woman of her rank and fortune and accomplishments
should be teaching in a mining camp.</p>

<p>"My rank? My fortune? My accomplishments?"
she repeated, mystified.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, patronizingly, "a lady of rank and
fortune. I have met several Americans of fortune,&mdash;great
fortune,&mdash;in London and Paris&mdash;ah&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I am not a woman of rank and fortune, Lord
Kelwin. I am just a plain working woman."</p>

<p>He did not observe the amused smile about her eyes
and mouth. "You are not likely to find women of rank
and fortune in a mining camp."</p>

<p>"It's wonderful how much these American heiresses
think of titles, don't you know, Miss Bright. Why, a
man of rank can marry almost any American girl he
pleases."</p>

<p>"Just so," she assented. "He wins a fortune to pay
his debts, and squander otherwise; and she wins a title,
dragged into the dust by a degenerate nobleman, plus
enough unhappiness to make her miserable the rest of
her life. An interesting business proposition, truly!"</p>

<p>"Why, really, Miss Bright,&mdash;ah&mdash;I&mdash;ah&mdash;I fear you
grow sarcastic."</p>

<p>"<i>Really!</i> Did you discern any approach to sarcasm
in my remarks? I am surprised!"</p>

<p>He was not prepared for the mockery in her voice,
nor for something about her that made him feel that
she was his superior. Before he could formulate a suitable
reply, one quite in accord with his sentiments and
feelings, she continued:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"We shall doubtless live to see a social evolution.
The American man of genius, and force, and character
is too intent on his great task of carving out a fortune,
or winning professional or artistic distinction, to give
his days and nights to social life.</p>

<p>"Now there are noblewomen of the Old World who
are women of real distinction, vastly superior to many
men of their class, and who have not been spoiled by
too great wealth simply because their profligate brothers
have squandered the family fortunes.</p>

<p>"Now it occurs to me that it might be a great thing
for the progress of the human race, if the finest noblewomen
of the Old World, who are women of intellect,
and culture, and character, should seek in marriage our
men of brains and character.</p>

<p>"The time has come when the American man of the
highest type needs something more than a fashion plate
or a tailor's model for his mate."</p>

<p>"And have you no American women who could match
your paragons, your American <i>tradesmen</i>?" he asked,
contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she replied. "We have fine and noble
American women. I was just thinking how the Old
World could be invigorated by the infusion of fresh
blood from the vital, progressive New World. Just
think of a brainy, womanly Lady Somebody of England,
refusing to ally herself with an inane, worthless nobleman
of any country, and deliberately <i>choosing</i> a man of
the people here, a man whose achievements have made
him great! Is there not a college of heraldry somewhere
that places intellect and character and achievement
above rank and fortune?"</p>

<p>He could not fathom her.</p>

<p>"How queer you are, Miss Bright! Such marriages,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
he continued, in a tone of disgust, "would not be tolerated."</p>

<p>"Why not? They would be on a higher plane than
the ones you boast of. You exploit the marriage of
title and money. I suggest, as an advance upon that,
the marriage of the highest type of the noblewoman of
the Old World, with no fortune but her intellect, her
character, and her fine breeding, with the highest type
of noble manhood in America, a man large enough and
great enough to direct the progress of the world."</p>

<p>"Ally the daughters of our nobility with plebeian
Americans?&mdash;with working men?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Because we despise people in trades," he said, contemptuously.</p>

<p>"But the tradesmen who <i>make</i> the fortunes are quite
as good as their daughters, who barter themselves and
their fathers' wealth for titles. You seem to approve
of such alliances."</p>

<p>They had reached the veranda of the Clayton home.
Esther Bright's hand was on the door knob, and her
companion took his leave.</p>

<p>How radical she must seem to him!</p>

<p>As she entered her own room, she found a letter bearing
a London postmark. It was the first letter she had
received from Kenneth Hastings, and it was a long one.
She read it through, and then reread it, and buried her
face in her arms on the table. After awhile there came
a knock on the door. It was Carla. She had been
crying. Esther slipped an arm about her, and together
they sat on the edge of the bed.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Carla?" she asked gently.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so unhappy!"</p>

<p>"Has anyone hurt your feelings, dear?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no. It is not that. It is the other. I wish I
could die!"</p>

<p>Esther drew Carla to her.</p>

<p>"You still care for Mr. Clifton; is that it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered, with a sob, "that is it. I am
<i>so</i> unhappy!"</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it, Carla," said Esther, in a soothing
tone. "Perhaps it will be a relief for you to tell me.
When a load is shared it grows lighter."</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Papa and Mamma died, and I had no
one but distant kindred. They gave me a home, and I
became a sort of servant in the family. Mark Clifton
was their nephew. He seemed to love me, and he was the
only one who did. He talked often of the home we'd
have when we are married, as I told you.</p>

<p>"I was sixteen when he came to America. Then he
sent me money to come to him, saying we'd be married
on my arrival here.</p>

<p>"But when I reached Gila, he said he could not disgrace
his <i>family</i> by marrying <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>These words were followed by violent weeping. Then
Esther comforted her as best she could, and tucked her
in her own bed. At last Carla fell into a heavy sleep.</p>

<p>Again Esther opened Kenneth's letter, read it, and
placed it in her Bible.</p>

<p>So days came and went,&mdash;homely days, days of simple
duties, days of ministration to human need. And Esther
Bright was happy.</p>

<p>One day as she lingered late at the schoolhouse, she
was startled to see a young Apache, dressed as a cowboy,
standing in the doorway. For an instant, she felt a
sickening fear. Then her habit of self-control asserted
itself. She motioned him to a seat, but he did not seem
to understand. He spied her guitar, tried the strings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
shook his head, and muttered words unintelligible to her.</p>

<p>The Indian was, apparently, about her own age, tall,
muscular, and handsome. His long, glossy, black hair
hung about his shoulders. On his head, was a light felt
hat, similar to the ones worn by the cow-punchers. His
trousers and jacket were of skins and cloth respectively.
In a moment he looked up at her, from his seat on the
floor, and jabbered something. Apparently, he approved
of her. He touched her dress and jabbered something
else.
<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
"Nē-shē-äd-nlĕh´," he said, pointing southward towards
the Apache reservation.</p>

<p>She told him, in poor Spanish, that she could not understand;
but he apparently understood her, and looked
pleased. Again he repeated the same words, using much
gesticulation to help convey his meaning.</p>

<p>There was a step outside, and Robert Duncan appeared
with Bobbie.</p>

<p>After greeting the teacher, Robert looked with unbounded
astonishment at her unusual visitor. Apparently
the Apache was there on a friendly visit. The
Scotchman was about to pass on, when the teacher asked
him to stay. He entered the room, and said something
to the Indian, who answered,
<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>"Indä-stzän´ ū´-sn-bē-ceng-kĕ´."</p>

<p>Robert seemed to catch his meaning, and answered in
Spanish that the people called her the Angel of the
Gila.</p>

<p>The Apache nodded his head approvingly, and said,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
"Indä-stzän´ ū´-sn-bē-tse´!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p><p>He stepped up to the teacher, and took hold of her
arm as if to draw her away with him. She shook her
head, and pointed to Robert Duncan, who made signs
to him that she was his squaw. At last the Indian withdrew,
turning, from time to time, to look back at the vision
that, apparently, had bewitched him.</p>

<p>Then Robert explained his own errand. He was
seeking a mither for Bobbie. The bairn must have
a mither. He had understood her interest in the bairn
to be a corresponding interest in himself. He was
muckle pleased, he said, to be singled out for any woman's
favor. He was nae handsome man, he kenned
that weel. He was ready tae marry her any time she
telt him. Robert looked wonderfully pleased with himself,
apparently confident of a successful wooing. His
experience had been limited.</p>

<p>"You wish to marry me, Mr. Duncan?" Outwardly,
she was serious.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss, sen ye was sae willin', I thocht I maucht
as weel tak ye, an' then I'd not be bothered wi' ither
women.</p>

<p>"Have they troubled you?" she asked, with a look of
amusement. "Have they been attentive to you?"</p>

<p>"Not as attentive as y'rsel'."</p>

<p>"In what way have I been attentive to you, Mr. Duncan?"
she asked, looking still more amused.</p>

<p>"Ye've helpit me bairn, an' cleaned his claes, an'
let him ca' ye mither. Ye'd no hae doon that wi'oot
wishin' the faither, too."</p>

<p>His confidence was rather startling.</p>

<p>"But suppose I do not wish the father. What then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that could never be," he said, "that could never
be."</p>

<p>"You have made a mistake, Mr. Duncan," she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
quietly. "You will have to look elsewhere for a wife.
Good afternoon."</p>

<p>Saying which, she turned the key in the door, and
left him standing dumb with astonishment.</p>

<p>After she had gone some distance, he called after her:
"Ye are makin' the mistak o' y'r life!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<h3>OVER THE MOUNTAINS</h3>

<p class="cap">O<span class="smcap">ne</span> Friday early in May, Edith Clayton suddenly
became ill. Esther, returning from
school, found Mrs. Clayton deeply distressed.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "if Mr. Clayton or the
boys were only here to take Edith to Carlisle, to see Dr.
Brown!"</p>

<p>"How soon will they return?"</p>

<p>"Two days. I'm afraid to drive myself, and Edith
sick."</p>

<p>"Does she know the way there, Mrs. Clayton?" Esther
seemed weighing the matter.</p>

<p>"Yes; she has gone with her father several times."</p>

<p>"Then if she is able to ride, and you are not afraid
to trust me, I'll take her. It is Friday, and still early."</p>

<p>"But, my dear, it is fifteen miles away, a long fatiguing
journey over rough mountain roads. You'll
have to ford a river, and stay all night at a ranch beyond
the ford. Besides, it is a perilous drive. Oh,
dear! I am so worried!" Here she broke down completely.</p>

<p>"Don't let us waste any time, Mrs. Clayton. If you
think Edith can endure the journey, I am willing to
run the risk. I'll take her myself."</p>

<p>"I believe Edith could go all right,&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind anything else. Give us the safe team,
and we'll start."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>A spirited team was soon at the door, and they were
placing wraps, cushions and luncheon in the carriage.
Then Esther and Edith started.</p>

<p>For a few miles, they repeatedly crossed bridges over
the Gila, then their road followed the foothills for some
distance. The hills were still yellow with the silky California
poppies. Green alfalfa fields, in the valley below,
looked like bits of Eden let down into the grimly
majestic scene. Higher the travelers rode, and higher.
At a sudden turn, they came upon the narrow and perilous
canyon road, where they drove slowly, drinking in
the grandeur of it all.</p>

<p>The tinkling of a cowbell warned them that they were
approaching a human habitation. As they rounded a
sharp jag, they came upon a picturesque bridge, near the
farther end of which they caught a glimpse of a pine-slab
cabin, half hidden by tremulous aspens. A little
Mexican child stood near the door, helping himself to
the pink and white blossoms of the wild sweet pea.
Near by, a white cow, with her clanking bell, browsed
on the green turf that bordered that side of the stream.</p>

<p>On and up the mountain, the travelers rode, into the
heart of the Rockies.</p>

<p>"Just look at that rose-colored sandstone," said Esther.
"How exquisitely veined! See the gigantic,
overhanging mass of rock beyond! And oh, the cactus
blossoms! How glorious! The large scarlet blossoms!
See?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Exquisite, aren't they? But look at those
cliffs over in that direction, Miss Bright," said Edith,
pointing to her left, as she spoke. "Do you see anything
unusual?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Quaint figures. Indian art, isn't it? I do
wish I could see it nearer by."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>And so they traveled on, reveling in the beauty everywhere
about them.</p>

<p>"Does it ever occur to you," asked Edith, "that God
is nearer to us here, in the mountains, than anywhere
else?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Does God seem nearer to you here?"</p>

<p>"Much nearer. When we went home to England the
last time, I missed something. It seemed to me it was
God. We went to the churches and heard great preachers,
but they did not make me feel the presence of God
as the mountains do. When I come out into the open,
as you call it, and see the mountains, it seems to me I
could reach my hand out and find God."</p>

<p>"The mountains do great things for us," said Esther,
looking up at the jagged cliffs.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a whir of wings. An enormous
eagle roused from his perch on the rocks, made a bold
swoop, and soared grandly above their heads.</p>

<p>"Look, look!" cried Esther, in excitement. "An
eagle, isn't it? Oh, you splendid creature! How
magnificently free!" Her cheeks flushed.</p>

<p>"Did you never see one before?"</p>

<p>"Yes, stuffed; but this bird is alive and free." She
looked at Edith.</p>

<p>"You look pale, Edith," she said, with sudden alarm.
"Are you feeling worse?"</p>

<p>"No. Only tired. We'll soon reach the clearing, and
just beyond that, the ford; and just beyond that, the
ranch house. So I can soon rest."</p>

<p>Esther drew a deep breath, and said:</p>

<p>"I feel as though the spirit of the eagle had entered
into me."</p>

<p>But darkness was coming on apace. To their relief
they soon entered the clearing, and reached the bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of the stream, where they halted a few minutes. The
horses pricked up their ears.</p>

<p>"Do you think the ford is dangerous now, Edith?"</p>

<p>"It is usually quite safe at this season, unless there
has been a cloudburst. The horses know the ford, and
are used to crossing. Papa gives them the rein, and
they have always brought him safely through. We had
better place our luggage on the seat," she said, "and
keep our feet up. Tuck your skirts up, or you'll get
a drenching."</p>

<p>Then she leaned forward, and called each horse by
name.</p>

<p>In a moment they were in the river, with the water
up to the horses' shoulders. They felt the carriage swing
with the current, and felt the team struggling with the
force of the waters. Then Esther called to the horses,
in tones that showed no fear, "Well done, Rocket! On, Star, on!"</p>

<p>It seemed hours to her before the faithful animals
were once more on the shore, and safe.</p>

<p>"Were you frightened, Miss Bright?" asked Edith.</p>

<p>"Just a little. I never forded a stream before. But
how nobly the horses behaved!"</p>

<p>"Yes. It must be a hard struggle for them, though."</p>

<p>In about five minutes, they stopped before a house,
tied their team, and knocked at the door. A refined-looking
young woman received them.</p>

<p>"Why, Esther Bright!" she exclaimed, with a little
shriek, clasping Esther in her arms.</p>

<p>"Why, Grace Gale! Bless your heart! Where in
the world did you come from? Grace, this is my friend,
Miss Edith Clayton. She is ill, and I am taking her to
see Dr. Brown in Carlisle. We are seeking the hospitality
of this house overnight."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>
<p>Before she was through speaking, Grace Gale was half
carrying Edith into the house.</p>

<p>"Come right in, come right in!" she said. "I'm delighted!
Tickled to death to see some one I know!"</p>

<p>She ushered them into a room guiltless of carpet,
meagerly furnished, but immaculately clean. Then she
excused herself to send some one to attend to the horses,
and to tell her landlady she would entertain two guests
over night. She soon returned.</p>

<p>"But how did <i>you</i> happen to come so far from civilization,
Esther?" she questioned.</p>

<p>"Oh, a combination of circumstances; but chiefly
through Mrs. Clayton, whom I met in England. What
brought you out here?"</p>

<p>"I came for restoration of health," she answered,
laughing merrily, as though it were all a joke.</p>

<p>"I don't look very sickly now, do I? I had had
double pneumonia, and my physician ordered me to
leave Boston, and go to a dry climate. So I came to
Arizona. I happened to meet the superintendent of
education. He needed teachers. So I came here, just
for the fun of the thing."</p>

<p>"And has it been fun?", asked Esther, joining in
her friend's laughter.</p>

<p>"Fun? There have been so many funny things I
have laughed myself into stitches. For example, my
landlady refuses to let me have any extra bedding for
to-night."</p>

<p>"Never mind. We have our cushions and lap-robe
to help out. Who would have dreamed, Grace, when
we were at Wellesley, that we should meet way out here
in the wilds of Arizona? Oh, I'm <i>so</i> glad to see you!"</p>

<p>"So am I, to see you. Now tell me all you know
about the girls of our class, Esther."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>They were in the midst of a vivacious conversation,
when a sleek, tow-headed woman appeared at the door,
and was presented to them. Then she announced supper,
and disappeared.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened," whispered the merry hostess
to her guests. "She's tame, and won't bite, and the
food is clean."</p>

<p>The landlady entered the kitchen, and after serving
them, left the room.</p>

<p>The hours sped merrily. The sick girl lay on the little
bed, listening to college reminiscences, and joining occasionally
in the conversation and laughter.</p>

<p>"Esther," said Miss Gale, "let's give the Wellesley
yell for Edith."</p>

<p>"Well! Here goes!" said Esther, joining her friend.
Suddenly, the tow-head appeared at the door.</p>

<p>"Be ye sick?" inquired the surprised hostess.</p>

<p>"No," answered Miss Gale, "only giving our college
yell."</p>

<p>"Ye don't say! Is them the kind er doin's ye has
where ye goes ter school?"</p>

<p>"A yell is a safety-valve, don't you see, Mrs. Svenson?"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Svenson left the room mumbling to herself.</p>

<p>At a late hour, Grace Gale made a shake down of one
blanket, for Esther and herself. Then Esther proposed
they use Mrs. Clayton's cushions, and shawls, and robe,
to complete the preparations. Edith slept in the bed.</p>

<p>After a while, the hostess asked:</p>

<p>"Are your bones coming through, Esther?"</p>

<p>"No, but I am sorry to put you to such inconvenience.
I hope you won't take cold. There is a chill
in the air to-night."</p>

<p>"No more o' that, honey. I'm just glad to see you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
This is the biggest lark I have had since I came to
Arizona."</p>

<p>The visitors laughed with her.</p>

<p>"My! It is eleven o'clock, and I must not keep this
sick child awake any longer. Good night, Esther."</p>

<p>"Good night, Grace."</p>

<p>"Good night, Edith."</p>

<p>"Good night."</p>

<p>A long pause.</p>

<p>"Esther," softly, "are you asleep?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I am so glad you came. I was almost dead from
homesickness."</p>

<p>"Were you, Grace? I'm so sorry I didn't know you
were so near."</p>

<p>On the following morning, the vivacious hostess said:</p>

<p>"I can't let you go. I'm so lonely." And to her
surprise, tears rolled down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"You dear girl!" said Esther, slipping her arm about
her.</p>

<p>"Get your hat, and go with us on our visit to Dr.
Brown. We have enough luncheon to last us a week.
Come right along."</p>

<p>So off the three drove.</p>

<p>It was a perfect May day, the kind found only in
Arizona. The air was crystal clear, and the sky a deep
blue. All along, there were thickets of sweet briar, and
sweet peas; and cactuses, just beginning to bloom, made
the way one of continual splendor. The air was exhilarating;
so was the sunshine; so was Grace Gale.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're just as good as a tonic, Miss Gale," said
Edith. All three seemed to see the funny side of everything,
and laughed even when there was no excuse for
laughing. The gladness of the day was contagious.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>The physician looked grave when he saw the unnatural
pallor of Edith's face, and noted her heart
action.</p>

<p>"It is well Miss Bright brought you to me at once,
Edith," he said. "You need immediate medical attention.
I wish you could remain with us a few days."</p>

<p>But she insisted upon returning with her teacher.</p>

<p>After a due amount of rest and refreshment, they
started homeward, leaving Miss Gale at her boarding
place. Then the two approached the ford again. The
stream was higher than on the preceding day, and the
waters raging.</p>

<p>Once more the spirited team dashed forward. Once
more the carriage swung with the current; only, now,
it was swifter and stronger than on the day before.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is terrible!" said Edith, grasping her companion's
arm.</p>

<p>"Keep up courage, Edith," said Esther. "I think
we'll make it."</p>

<p>But she noted the deathly whiteness of the girl's face.</p>

<p>"Steady, Rocket! Steady, Star!" said the teacher.
Her own face grew tense and white.</p>

<p>She felt the carriage swing with a sudden lurch, and
it began to dawn upon her that the horses might lose
in the struggle. She lifted the reins, and called out
above the roar of the waters:</p>

<p>"On, Rocket! On, Star! Once more, my beauties!
Bravo! Oh, God, give them strength! On!"</p>

<p>She rose in her excitement, and swung the reins.</p>

<p>The noble animals struggled madly. Could they gain
the opposite bank? She was filled with sickening fear.</p>

<p>"On, Rocket! On, Star!" she urged again.</p>

<p>At that moment, the exhausted animals gained the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
mastery, sprang up the embankment, and stopped suddenly
on the level beyond, quivering from their terrific
struggle.</p>

<p>Esther gave the reins to Edith, and springing from the
carriage, she stepped to the horses' heads, patting and
stroking them. Her voice trembled as she said:</p>

<p>"Rocket, my brave, Star, my beauty, we owe our
lives to you."</p>

<p>They whinnied as if they understood.</p>

<p>She put her cheek to their noses, she laughed, she
cried.</p>

<p>"I believe they understand," she said.</p>

<p>"I feel sure they do," answered Edith.</p>

<p>When Esther climbed back into the carriage, she
found Edith had fainted. She waited till her patient
regained consciousness, and then they started homeward.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Edith, after they had gone some
distance, "we have had a very narrow escape? A little
more, and we'd have been swept down the river."</p>

<p>"I didn't realize the full danger until we were in the
midst of the torrent," said Esther. "There was no
choice but to go on. I thank God that your life is safe,
dear," she added, drawing the girl affectionately to her.
"I hope our troubles are over now, and that you'll feel
no ill effects from the fright."</p>

<p>They had covered miles of the return journey, and
had reached the canyon road leading directly to Gila.
Here, for a short distance, the canyon stream spreads
wide, flowing over a pebbly bottom. The water sparkled
in the sunlight like a stream of diamonds. In the shallows,
the bed of the stream seemed jeweled with rubies
and emeralds, opals and amethysts, as the pebbles below
the crystal water shimmered in the late sunshine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>They were within a mile of Gila when they heard the
sharp, shrill cry of wolves. Esther tightened the reins,
and the horses fairly flew.</p>

<p>"Have we a gun with us, Miss Bright? We ought
to have one. I always feel safer when I have a gun.
You never know what you may meet on these mountain
roads."</p>

<p>"Can you shoot?" asked Esther.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; father trained me to shoot. Oh, those terrible
wolves!" she said, as the shrill, mournful cries
came nearer.</p>

<p>"On, Rocket! On, Star!" urged Esther, again.</p>

<p>The animals made a sudden lunge, and sped onward
like mad. Around jagged turns they flew, as if inviting
death; near precipitous cliffs they swung, till the driver
was filled with sickening terror. On they raced, the
wolves in hot pursuit.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" said Edith, looking back. "One large
wolf is far in advance, and close upon us."</p>

<p>Quick as a flash, she stooped, took a great haunch of
venison Dr. Brown had sent to her father, and flung it
behind them. Then she watched in intense excitement.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, striking her hands together,
"the wolf has discovered the venison, and has stopped!"</p>

<p>With that, she took the whip, and gave the already
excited animals a stinging blow. They leaped and
plunged madly forward. Esther doubled the reins
around her hands, and called in low, insistent tones:</p>

<p>"Steady, Rocket! Steady, Star!"</p>

<p>They had gained upon their pursuers, and the horses
were running at furious speed.</p>

<p>"The she-wolf," said Edith, looking back, "is again
following; but the smaller wolves are snarling over the
venison."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ow-ee-ow," came the wolf-cry, shriller, sharper,
nearer. Esther shuddered. She urged the horses on.
Edith grasped her arm in terror.</p>

<p>"The wolf is just behind us!" she said.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was the report of a gun. Esther
glanced back, and saw the wolf fall in the road. She
glanced ahead, and, at first, she saw no one. Then, out
from the shade of a group of pines, rode Kenneth
Hastings.</p>

<p>"Whoa! Whoa!" he called, as he leaped from his
own horse, and caught Rocket by the bits. With a sudden
lurch, the team came to a standstill.</p>

<p>"Whoa, Rocket! Whoa, Star!" he called soothingly,
as he held and quieted the team.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, thank you, Mr. Hastings!" said Esther.
"When did you reach Gila?"</p>

<p>"We're <i>so</i> glad to see you!" said both, as he stepped
to the carriage and extended a hand to each.</p>

<p>"But how did you happen to be here?" asked Esther.</p>

<p>"I came in this morning. Mrs. Clayton told me you
had gone to Carlisle, and would be back about this
time. I have felt anxious about you ever since I heard
you had undertaken this journey."</p>

<p>Again both repeated their gratitude for his timely
assistance. He could see they were trembling.</p>

<p>"Your horses were running away," he said. "They
are nervous creatures, and are still frightened."</p>

<p>After a while, he suggested that they drive on slowly,
while he kept guard, in case wolves should pursue them
farther. Then he mounted his horse, and rode beside
their carriage.</p>

<p>So they covered the remaining distance, talking of
many things that had happened during the weeks of
his absence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>As they approached the Clayton residence, Mrs. Clayton
and Carla came out to welcome them.</p>

<p>"How are you, Edith?" questioned the anxious
mother.</p>

<p>"I hardly know," answered the girl. "I've been
frightened nearly to death. I guess the fright cured
me."</p>

<p>"I think she is better," added Esther. "Dr. Brown's
medicine has helped her."</p>

<p>"But what frightened you?" asked the mother.</p>

<p>Then Edith told of the peril of the ford, and of the
pursuit of the wolves, dwelling on Kenneth's opportune
assistance.</p>

<p>"We owe a great deal to you, Kenneth," said Mrs.
Clayton, her eyes filling with tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, that was only a trifle, Mrs. Clayton," he said,
carelessly.</p>

<p>"Come dine with us to-night, Kenneth, won't you?"
asked his friend.</p>

<p>After thanking her, he mounted his horse, lifted his
cap, and went on his way to headquarters.</p>

<p>And Esther Bright! What was in her heart? We
shall see.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE DAY OF THE GREAT RACE</h3>

<p class="cap">I<span class="smcap">t</span> was pay-day in Gila. Miners from far and near
were in camp. Cow-punchers had come from the
range; cowlasses, also, were to be seen here and
there, chaffing with men they knew. The one
street had suddenly taken on human interest.
Representatives of different nations were to be seen in
all directions, some going to, and some coming from the
saloons. Groups of men and women gathered to gossip.
Comments on affairs of the community, and especially
on the approaching race, were freely interlarded with
profanity. Along the street, strolled Lord Kelwin,
puffing away at a cigar. Apparently he was a good
"mixer."</p>

<p>"So you've entered your mare fur the race," said a
cow-puncher, slapping him familiarly on the back.
"What in blank do you expect her to do? She ain't fit
fur nothin' but takin' gals hossback ridin', eh?"
And he laughed uproariously at his attempt at wit.
"Better cut out that part of the race. That belongs to
another brand o' cattle. Come! Have a drink."
Saying which, they entered the saloon where Pete
Tompkins presided.</p>

<p>The air was already stiff with smoke and profanity.
Men had congregated there soon after receiving their
wages.</p>

<p>In a little room apart, sat men intent on a game of
cards. Lord Kelwin joined them. One of the players,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
a mining engineer, was a professional gambler, who
frequently raked into his pockets the hard-earned wages
of many laboring men. Everyone save the engineer
seemed tense. Once in a while, a smothered oath was
heard. At the close of the game, the Irish lord, also,
began to play. He had been drinking, and though an
experienced player, he was no match for the sober
gambler. He lost heavily. At the close of the game,
he drank again, then staggered out of the door. Ah,
how many had done the same!</p>

<p>Pete Tompkins followed, gibing him about entering
the mare in the race.</p>

<p>"What in blank are ye enterin' her fur?" asked the
aforesaid Pete.</p>

<p>The men gathered about expectant of a fray.</p>

<p>"What am&mdash;I&mdash;entering her&mdash;for&mdash;(staggering and
hiccoughing)&mdash;entering her for? Ye blanked Americans!&mdash;I'm
entering her for Miss Bright&mdash;Miss Bright,
ye know&mdash;Miss Bright&mdash;" He laughed a silly laugh.
"I'm going to marry her." Here, he indulged in a
drunken jest that sent some of the men into fits of
laughter.</p>

<p>A few, standing outside the door, had attended the
men's club and the Sunday service. Jack Harding,
passing at that moment, stopped to speak with one of
the men, and overheard the reference to Esther Bright.
His face grew sternly white. He stepped in front of
the boastful Irishman, and said in a stern, quiet voice:</p>

<p>"Brute, say that you lied."</p>

<p>"Blank you, you religious hypocrite," roared Lord
Kelwin, "you can't bully me!"</p>

<p>Jack Harding sprang upon him, gripped his throat
like a vice, and demanded that he retract every insulting
word he had said about the teacher.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
"What is that to you? Blank you!" gasped the
Irishman.</p>

<p>Jack Harding's grasp tightened.</p>

<p>"Say it," he repeated, in deadly quiet tones. "Say
that all you said about that pure, good woman is a lie."</p>

<p>His tone was as inexorable as fate.</p>

<p>The Irishman's eyes grew fixed with terror, his tongue
hung from his mouth, his face grew purple. Still that
calm intense voice reiterating in his ear:</p>

<p>"Say it! Say that all you said was a lie."</p>

<p>Seeing Lord Kelwin's extreme danger, some one attempted
to interfere. Cries were heard:</p>

<p>"Let them alone!"</p>

<p>"It's none of your funeral!"</p>

<p>"Jack Harding was right. Kelwin <i>did</i> lie, and he's
a blackguard for saying what he did."</p>

<p>Then man after man took up the cry:</p>

<p>"Kelwin, ye blanked coward, <i>say</i> ye lied! Ye know
ye lied!"</p>

<p>At last the Irishman gave the sign. Jack Harding
released him. Then, somewhat sobered, he muttered:</p>

<p>"I did lie about a true woman. All I said was a lie."</p>

<p>He staggered from the scene, and Jack Harding
passed on his way.</p>

<p>The race was to be on a track in the valley below.
As it was Saturday, John Clayton had suggested to
Esther that she and Edith take a horseback ride with
him, to see the last part of the race; for, he assured her,
she would see human life, as well as horse speed, there.</p>

<p>As they approached the track from the mountain
road, hoarse cries and yells could be heard. Excitement
ran high.</p>

<p>A few thoroughbreds had been entered for the race,
but the greater number of entries were for horse-flesh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
that could boast neither registered sires nor grandsires.
They were just "horses."</p>

<p>The last race began just as the Clayton party turned
and looked down on the wriggling, shoving, cursing
crowd below. It is doubtful if Esther Bright had ever
heard such language, in all her life, as she heard that
day. She shuddered, and turning to her escort, asked
why he had brought her there.</p>

<p>"Just for you to see what animals human beings are,
and how great is their need of refining, uplifting influences."</p>

<p>"Is John Harding here?" she asked, uneasily.</p>

<p>"We are all here," he answered, smiling, "including
Jack. You need never worry about him again. You
found him a sinner, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And he has become a saint?" she supplemented.</p>

<p>"Not exactly a saint," he answered, "but you have
brought about a complete transformation in the man's
life and character. Jack could never return to what
he was, be sure of that!"</p>

<p>"Kelwin! Kelwin's ahead!" shouted a hoarse voice,
above the noise of the crowd.</p>

<p>"Blank ye!" retorted another, "Bill Hines is ahead!
I seen 'em turn fust!"</p>

<p>"Ye lie!" continued the first.</p>

<p>Away to the right, speeding around a curve in the
race course, four horses were straining every muscle.
Occasionally a cow-puncher would lift his quirt, and
make it hum through the air, or lash the poor beast, already
straining to its utmost speed.</p>

<p>For a few moments, the racers were concealed from
view by a mass of rocks. When they emerged again,
they were greeted by yells from bystanders. A cowlass,
mounted on a spirited animal, was in the lead. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
swore almost constantly at her horse, occasionally cutting
him with her quirt.</p>

<p>Lord Kelwin, now somewhat sobered, made a close
second; and Bill Hines and Bill Weeks were neck and
neck behind the Irishman.</p>

<p>The crowd cheered and cheered.</p>

<p>The girl leading was as fine a specimen of the human
animal as the horse she rode was of the horse kind. She
sat her horse superbly.</p>

<p>Finally, Lord Kelwin gained upon her, and the horses
were neck and neck. The girl again whirled her quirt
around till it cut the air with a hissing sound, and spoke
to her horse. It was enough.</p>

<p>The betting grew louder. The stakes grew heavier.</p>

<p>"I know Kelwin'll win yet."</p>

<p>"No, he won't. Kate Brown'll win. She's a devil
to ride, that girl is!"</p>

<p>Again the Irishman gained upon her. Again she sent
her quirt singing through the air, and her horse obeyed
as though horse and rider were one. He sped faster and
faster, passed Lord Kelwin, then the starting point,
and the race was won.</p>

<p>"Hurrah for Kate Brown and Lightning!" shouted
hoarse voices; and cowboys and cowlasses and everyone
else yelled and shouted, and shouted and yelled. It
seemed as though pandemonium had been let loose.</p>

<p>Jack Harding had gone to the races chiefly to dog
the steps of Lord Kelwin; so, if the Irishman had been
inclined to speak lightly of Esther Bright again, he
would have had to reckon with him. Kelwin felt himself
shadowed by the cowboy, and a great fear took
possession of him.</p>

<p>As he dismounted, his scant clothing was wet, and
clung to his person. The race had not improved his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
temper any. To be beaten, and beaten by a woman,
and that woman an American cowlass, was the very limit
of what he could endure from "raw America" that day.
He swore to the right of him; he swore to the left of
him. Then glancing over the crowd, he discovered the
Clayton party overlooking the scene.</p>

<p>John Clayton, ignorant of the episode at the saloon,
was beckoning him to join them. Lord Kelwin was
about to do so, when Jack Harding stepped up to him
and said:</p>

<p>"Don't you dare enter that woman's presence!"</p>

<p>Lord Kelwin placed his hand on his gun, saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't give me any of your impudent
American advice, you mongrel cur!"</p>

<p>"Never mind what I am," said Jack; "that woman
is one of the truest, purest souls on earth. You are not
fit to enter her presence. You have <i>me</i> to deal with,
remember."</p>

<p>His great eyes flashed upon the Irishman, who quailed
before him.</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't be so high and mighty," said Lord
Kelwin, changing his tactics. "I don't care a blank
about her, anyway. She's only an American working
woman, an Indian at that."</p>

<p>"So this is nobility," Jack said to himself. "Nobility!
What is it to be <i>noble</i>?"</p>

<p>The race was followed by a dance in one of the
saloons, and the lowest of the low were there. At four
o'clock in the morning, those sober enough went to their
homes; the others stretched out anywhere, in a deep
drunken sleep; and pay-day and its pleasuring were
over. Men and women awakened to find their money
gone; and for the first time in years, they felt shame.</p>

<p>Sunday came. The hour of the service drew near.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
Esther Bright had thought out what she would say
that day about the Race for Life. But when she
rose to speak, she had a strange experience. All she
had thought to say, vanished; and before her mind's
eye, she saw the words, "The wages of sin is death."</p>

<p>There were perhaps a hundred people before her in
the timber (where the services were now held),&mdash;men
and women among them, who, the day before, had forgotten
they were created in the image of God, and who
had groveled to the level of beasts.</p>

<p>These men, these women, had come to this spot this
day, why, they did not know. Why Esther Bright
said the things she said that day, <i>she</i> did not know,
either. All she knew was that the words came, and
that there were men and women before her whom she
must help.</p>

<p>Those who had sunken so low the day before, cried
out in repentance, as they listened to her words. God's
message, through Esther Bright's voice, had come to
men's business and bosoms. Called of God, she said
they were,&mdash;called to be true men, true women. From
time to time, she quoted, "The wages of sin is death."
One could almost hear his heart beat.</p>

<p>The meeting was over, so far as Esther Bright's part
in it was concerned; then it passed from her control.
First one, then another rose, confessed his sins, and asked
for her prayers.</p>

<p>And what of Esther? She sat as pale as death, her
face alight with a sweetness and compassion that did
not seem of earth.</p>

<p>Kenneth Hastings watched her with deepening reverence.
Her words had gone to his heart, too, and he
sang with deep feeling:</p>

<p>"Just as I am, without one plea."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>As the song ceased, Pete Tompkins (to everyone's
amazement) sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Ye'll be s'prised ter hear from me, I reckon,"&mdash;Here
he shoved his hand, lean and gaunt, up through
his hair. "But I've been listenin' ter schoolma'am ever
sence she begun preachin' in the timber, an' all I've
got ter say is she ain't <i>our</i> brand, or the Devil's brand
either. When the Boss sent out his puncher ter round
up folks, he cut her out an' branded her with the mark
o' God. I know she's tellin' the gospel truth. She's
got more courage 'n any blanked one o' yer. I done
'er a mean trick onct. I said blanked mean things
about 'er. I'm sorry I done it, blanked ef I ain't!
Ter show 'er an' you that I mean ter be differ'nt, I
say, here an' now, that I wanter see these meetin's go
on, 's long 's schoolma'am 'll be our angel an' pilot
us. Ter prove I mean it, I'll plank down this hunderd
dollars" (holding up a hundred-dollar bill) "toward
buildin' a meetin' house; an' I'll give more, blanked ef
I don't! How many wants a meetin' house in Gila?
Stand up!"</p>

<p>Many stood.</p>

<p>"<i>Stand up, the hull blanked lot o' ye!</i>" said the self-appointed
leader in forcible tones. To Esther's astonishment,
the people rose, and remained standing.</p>

<p>The notes of a thrush were caught up by a mocking
bird, then a warbler joined in, and the waiting people
listened. The song of the birds "came like the benediction
that follows after prayer."</p>

<p>At last the company dispersed, and Esther Bright
sat alone, absorbed in silent prayer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>NIGHT ON THE RANGE</h3>

<p class="cap">T<span class="smcap">he</span> cowboys and cowlasses had long been
back on the range, and the attendance at
the clubs had decreased in consequence.</p>

<p>Many still came to the Sunday service in
the timber; and the children remained in
the school, notwithstanding the increasing heat.</p>

<p>Continuous labor, and the intense heat, were beginning
to tell on Esther Bright. As June approached, she
occasionally spoke of going home; but whenever she
did so, there was a chorus of protests, especially from
Kenneth Hastings. Couldn't she spend the summer in
Arizona, and they would camp on one of the forest
mesas, a party of them? It would give her new life and
strength.</p>

<p>She shook her head listlessly. One idea grew and
possessed her: she must go home, home to her grandfather.</p>

<p>Into Esther's manner, when in the presence of Kenneth
Hastings, had come a deepening reserve. And yet,
from time to time, she spoke with feeling of her gratitude
to him for rescuing Edith and herself on the day of his
return. Her erstwhile gayety had departed, and in its
place was a seriousness that seemed akin to sadness.</p>

<p>Kenneth Hastings studied her, puzzled. He shared
the solicitude the Claytons evidently felt for her. All
knew she had drawn too lavishly upon her strength in
her unselfish service for others. They also knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
warnings and protests availed nothing; that she must
learn through experience the necessity of conservation
of energy. Too useful a woman, Kenneth Hastings
said of her, to wear herself out in service for a lot of
common people. But he did not understand. He was
to learn.</p>

<p>At the close of a fatiguing day, a day of withering
heat, John Clayton came home to dinner, bringing Kenneth
with him. Esther Bright and Edith Clayton sat
on the veranda as they approached.</p>

<p>"Miss Bright," said the host, "I have a proposition
to make:&mdash;that you and Mrs. Clayton accompany Mr.
Hastings and me to Clifton to-morrow. Fortunately,
to-morrow will be Friday. We can start soon after
school is dismissed, and return Saturday, riding in the
cool of the day."</p>

<p>"Delightful!" she exclaimed, with evident pleasure,
"How far is it?"</p>

<p>"About twenty miles, I think," he answered.</p>

<p>"Twenty miles? On horseback? I'm afraid I can't
endure the fatigue of so long a ride. I am already so
tired!"</p>

<p>"Really!" said Kenneth, in a mocking tone. "You
at last acknowledge that you are tired! I am astonished."</p>

<p>But she was unresponsive.</p>

<p>As the plans were discussed for the long ride, Esther
gradually roused, and entered into the occasion with
spirit. It was decided that the four should go in the
surrey. Carla and Edith were to remain at home; and
as Jack Harding was still in camp, he was to be general
protector of the girls until the return of the party.</p>

<p>As the sun began to lower, Friday afternoon, the
party drove away from camp, first north, then east, toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
Clifton. They crossed and recrossed the Gila
River for some distance, passing many of the abandoned
cliff dwellings along the canyon. Everywhere, the desert
foothills, and the crevices of jagged, cliffs were ablaze
with cactus blossoms. As the cool came on, the air grew
delightful, and Esther seemed to awaken once more to
the pure joy of living.</p>

<p>Could they tell her anything of the cliff dwellers?
They certainly could. And John Clayton told her
of the Hopi Indians, and their customs. People of
peace they were; keepers of sheep, lovers of the heavens,
and knew the mystery of the stars as no one else did.
Their men honored their women, he said. And then he
laughingly told her that the Hopi Indians were women
suffragists. The Hopi women, he said, were given more
rights than were the women of civilization.</p>

<p>"What rights?" she asked.</p>

<p>Then he described his visit to Hopi land, telling her
of the superior place the Hopi woman occupies in the
life of the Hopi people.</p>

<p>The talk drifted to Indians in general, Esther Bright
asking many questions, indicating on her part a deep
and growing interest in these native lords of the valleys
and mesas.</p>

<p>Just as they were crossing a bridge over the river,
they met Lord Kelwin on horseback. It was the first
time they had met him since the race. John Harding
had not seen fit to tell Kenneth or the Claytons of his
experiences with the Irishman, as long as he himself
was in camp to protect Esther Bright.</p>

<p>John Clayton reined in his horses to greet Lord Kelwin.
The Irishman spoke to them, but looked at Esther.
After learning their destination and the probable time
of their return, he lifted his cap and rode on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>Esther Bright was annoyed. She could hardly have
told why.</p>

<p>"Lord Kelwin is a genial fellow," John Clayton remarked,
turning to speak to Esther; but, observing the
expression of her face, he asked in a surprised tone:</p>

<p>"Don't you like Lord Kelwin, Miss Bright?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, quietly.</p>

<p>Kenneth laughed. Then, turning around, he said in
a bantering tone:</p>

<p>"But he told me you had gone horseback riding with
him, daily, while I was away."</p>

<p>"He's mistaken, Kenneth," responded John Clayton.
"Miss Bright went riding with him about three times."</p>

<p>"Three times too many," said Kenneth, apparently
teasing, but with an undertone of seriousness. Mrs.
Clayton adroitly turned the conversation.</p>

<p>"John, tell Miss Bright about your meeting General
C."</p>

<p>Then he told how the general came to Arizona, and
of his wise dealings with the red men. He explained
the reason for the great unrest of the Indians after the
general withdrew. He told how he was summoned from
the Department of the Platte in 1882, and of the capture
of Geronimo and his band.</p>

<p>"And Geronimo is supposed to be the father of our
little Wathemah!" Esther exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Some think so," he said. "I have my doubts. He
looks as though he might be a mixture of Apache, Mexican
and Spanish."</p>

<p>"Whatever he is, he is an attractive child," she said.
"How did you come to meet General C.?"</p>

<p>"He and his troops marched through Gila. I entertained
the officers at the ranch over night."</p>

<p>As he spoke, they came upon a pappoose, tied to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
tree, and blinking in the afternoon sunshine. Just beyond,
they found a group of Apaches. The women were
cooking fish over live coals of fire. The men seemed to
recognize John Clayton. He greeted them in the tongue
of the Mexicans, as he drove by, while the Indians jabbered
and gesticulated violently.</p>

<p>At the bridge just beyond, they crossed the Gila for
the last time before turning northward. There, they
saw a young Apache catching fish. He glanced up, and
Esther recognized in him the visitor who had found her
at the schoolhouse. It was evident he knew her, for he
started towards the surrey.</p>

<p>"He is one of the friendly Apaches," explained John
Clayton. "He's often on the range, and has adopted
some of the cowboy regimentals, you see."</p>

<p>The driver stopped his horses.</p>

<p>The Indian came forward, offering John Clayton a
number of fish strung on a withe. As he did so, he
turned towards Esther, and said:</p>

<p>"Nē-shē-äd-nlĕh´."</p>

<p>"What does he mean?" asked Esther.</p>

<p>"I think he wants to buy you from me with these
fish," answered John Clayton, turning to her with an
amused smile.</p>

<p>Putting his hand into a tin box, he took from it a
handful of cookies, gave them to the young Indian, and
drove on. As they looked back, the last cake was about
to disappear down the Indian's throat.</p>

<p>"Poor things," said Esther, "they have had no
chance."</p>

<p>Then Kenneth rallied her on becoming a missionary
to the Indians.</p>

<p>"I'd be glad to help them as the early Jesuit priests
did," she answered. "I cannot but feel that the Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
policy has been very faulty, and that the Indians have
been the victims of grafters, some unprincipled Indian
agents, and the scum of the white race. You tell me,
Mr. Clayton, that the Mexican government offered a
bounty of $100 for every Apache man's scalp, $50 for
every Apache woman's scalp, and $25 for every Apache
child's scalp? I'd fight, too," she continued, indignantly.
"I know I'd fight. Poor things!"</p>

<p>The company laughed at her championship, and told
her how vicious the Apaches were, and many more matters
of Indian history.</p>

<p>The company were approaching a narrow canyon,
through which they must pass for some distance. The
waters dashed and boiled in eddies, where huge bowlders
obstructed the way, making a pleasant murmur to the
ear, soft and musical and low.</p>

<p>And Esther Bright listened. Her heart, stirred to
sudden anger by the stories of injustice and cruel wrong,
was soothed into quiet by this slumber song of the ages.
Oh, the music of the waters of the canyon! How, once
heard, it echoes in the heart forever! In the midst of
the unrest and discord of the world, how the memory
of it keeps one close to the very heart of things! How
it lingers! How it sings!</p>

<p>They drove under, then around, an overhanging rock,
beyond which, like ruins of ancient castles, storm-scarred,
majestic, towered cliffs to a height of a thousand feet
or more. The shadows had deepened in the canyon,
adding to the solemn grandeur of it all. From every
cleft of rock, apparently, a cactus had sprung into life,
and had blossomed into flowers of exquisite beauty. All
the journey was like a triumphal way, garlanded with
flowers.</p>

<p>At last they reached an open place in the canyon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
and followed a track leading upward to a level plain.
A short drive up a rocky way brought them to a vast
mesa. Here they halted for the night.</p>

<p>Some distance to the west, Esther spied a covered
wagon with horses tethered near. There was a man
busying himself about the wagon, and about the bonfire.
John Clayton explained to Esther that this was the
cook for the squads of cowboys, and that near where
the man was working, the men would camp for the night.
She watched the movements of the cook with some curiosity.</p>

<p>The Clayton party had now stepped from the surrey,
and removed from it the seats, blankets, and provisions.
The two men returned to the canyon to gather dry
driftwood for their fire for the night.</p>

<p>During the ride of the afternoon, as the company had
wound around the foothills, they had seen great herds
of cattle, thousands of cattle, on the hills and mesas.
But now, Esther was to see with her own eyes, the great
event of life on the range. This vast out-of-doors was
all so novel to her, so intensely interesting! She stood
and drew in great breaths of air. Her eyes darkened.
The pupils of her eyes had a way of dilating whenever
she felt deeply.</p>

<p>Although the cowboys and cowlasses had told Esther
much about the round-ups, she felt quite ignorant of
the whole matter. They had explained to her about the
free range, how it was divided into imaginary sections,
and how the "boss" cattleman would send groups of
cow-punchers to each of these various sections to look
after the cattle.</p>

<p>John Clayton and Kenneth Hastings returned from
the canyon, bringing a can of water, and dry driftwood.
They at once began to build their bonfire, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
prepare their evening meal. As they worked, they
talked.</p>

<p>"If you watch from here," suggested Kenneth,
"you'll see the close of the round-up, comfortably."</p>

<p>"What do they mean by 'cutting out' the cattle?"
asked Esther.</p>

<p>"Don't you know that yet?" laughed John Clayton.
"That is cowboy slang. As the cow-punchers approach
(cow-punchers are cowboys, you know&mdash;)"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that much."</p>

<p>"Well, as they approach you will see them weaving
in and out among the cattle, lashing some with their
quirts, and driving them out from the mass of cattle.
This is called 'cutting out.' The cattle of different
owners all run together on the range until time for the
round-ups."</p>

<p>"How often do they have these?" she asked.</p>

<p>"There are two general round-ups, spring and fall;
and others, when necessary for extra shipments of
cattle."</p>

<p>"How can they tell which belongs to which?"</p>

<p>"By the brand," explained Kenneth. "Each cattle
owner brands every one of his cattle with a certain mark,
which determines whose property the animal is."</p>

<p>The two women now placed cushions on the carriage
seats, and sat down to watch the close of the round-up.</p>

<p>The sunset was one of unusual splendor, the glory of
color falling over the mesa, and the mountain peaks that
loomed up far away. As they watched the sky, they
spied a cloud of dust in the distance.</p>

<p>"At last the cattle are coming!" exclaimed Mrs.
Clayton.</p>

<p>The dust cloud grew, coming nearer and nearer. It
had a fascination for Esther. While they were speculating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
as to the probable number of cattle, and the cowboys
and cowlasses who might be with them, Kenneth
Hastings and John Clayton sauntered over to the mess
wagon to await the closing scene. From that point,
the men watched; and from their location, the women
watched the on-coming herds. The dust cloud grew
larger. The great mass of struggling cattle came
steadily on. After a while, cowboys could be seen, and
whirling of ropes. Nearer and nearer they came, the
cowboys dealing stinging blows with their quirts. The
bellowing of cattle, the cursing of men, and the choking
fog of dust, all mingled together, came to the two
women, who watched from a safe distance. In their intense
interest, they forgot that the supper hour was long
past, and watched. They saw cow-punchers, weaving in
and out among the cattle, whirling ropes, and yelling,
and cursing by turns, until each cowboy had separated
the cattle in his charge from the others. It was an
enormous task. The men were still cursing and lashing,
when the last soft color of the afterglow faded from the
sky.</p>

<p>When the work of the round-up was finally over, and
the men were free for the night, Esther heard the cook
call out to them:</p>

<p>"Grub's ready! Cut out y'r talkin'!" adding profanity,
as if to whet the appetites of the hungry men.
Then the cowboys, dirt begrimed, fell to, and were soon
eating with a relish that would have made dyspeptics
green with envy.</p>

<p>Slowly, John Clayton and Kenneth Hastings sauntered
back, finding their own repast ready for them. They,
too, had found a keen edge to their appetite. Esther
even went so far as to suggest that they might have done
well to have accepted the Apache's fish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whom do you suppose we found over there?" asked
Mr. Clayton.</p>

<p>"Our boys," suggested Esther.</p>

<p>"Yes, several who have been at the club and at the
meetings. They know you are here, Miss Bright. Let's
see what they'll do."</p>

<p>Before the meal was over, the stars began to appear
in the heavens. John Clayton threw great quantities of
driftwood on the bonfire, and in a few moments, the
flames were licking the logs.</p>

<p>The voices of the cow-punchers came to them now
and then, but the profanity had ceased. Suddenly,
singing was heard. They listened. The cowboys were
singing, "There were ninety and nine."</p>

<p>From the singing, it was evident that the men were
approaching the Clayton camp. In a moment more,
they were there.</p>

<p>Would they be seated? John Clayton had asked. So,
around the camp fire they grouped, their faces and forms
indistinct in the flickering light. They made a weird
and picturesque group against the darkness of the night.</p>

<p>"An' phwat do yez think now of a round-up?" asked
Mike Maloney, of night school celebrity. Mike had been
the star pupil in arithmetic.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" said Esther, with contagious enthusiasm.
"To see that host of cattle approach, the ropes
swinging, the horses rearing and plunging, and the
magnificent setting of the mountains at sunset,&mdash;why,
it was glorious!"</p>

<p>The men grinned their delight.</p>

<p>Bill Weeks then grew eloquent about cattle.</p>

<p>"We come across a herd o' antelopes to-day," interrupted
another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>Bill Weeks returned again to his favorite theme.
Cattle were his life. In the midst of a dissertation on
their good points, he was again interrupted with:</p>

<p>"Oh, cut that out! Ye kin talk cattle any old day.
We wants ter hear Miss Bright sing."</p>

<p>"Yes, sing," all clamored. "<i>Do</i> sing!"</p>

<p>"What shall I sing?"</p>

<p>"'Oft in the Stilly Night,'" one suggested.</p>

<p>But they were not satisfied with one song, and called
loudly for another. Then she sang, "Flee as a bird to
Your Mountain."</p>

<p>Esther Bright, as she stood and sang that night, was
a picture one could never forget.</p>

<p>Then around the crackling fire, story after story was
told. The fire burned low. The dome above sparkled
with myriads of stars. At last the cowboys rose, and
returned to their camp.</p>

<p>"Now we'll heap up the fire for the night, Kenneth,"
said John Clayton, "and arrange our shakedowns."</p>

<p>"'Shakedowns,' John?" said his wife. "You don't
call a blanket and cushion on a mesa a shakedown,
do you?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>Then the two men withdrew to the farther side of the
fire. The women crawled into their blankets, and soon
felt the warmth of the still heated earth upon which
they lay.</p>

<p>"Good night!" called the men's voices, and "Good
night!" returned the women. Then silence brooded over
the camp.</p>

<p>For the first time in her life, Esther was bedded on the
ground. Her face was turned upward, her eyes, fixed
upon the starry deeps. Hour after hour went by. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
regular breathing of her fellow-travelers assured her
that all were asleep. She could not sleep.</p>

<p>The marvelous scene above her grew upon her. She
lay still, looking, looking into the infinite, that infinite
around her, above her, beyond and beyond forever, who
knows whither?</p>

<p>The air, at first dark about her, grew into a weird,
wonderful light. The dome grew vaster and vaster;
and, with the marvelous expansion, she began to realize
stars. They seemed to move from their solid ebon
background, and to float in space.</p>

<p>Stars! What do stars mean to the ordinary human?
Just stars that come and go as a matter of course; just
as men eat and drink, buy and sell, live and die. I say
Esther Bright began to <i>realize</i> stars. I do not mean
by that that she was unfamiliar with certain astronomical
facts all intelligent people are supposed to know.
Far from it. She knew much of mathematical astronomy.
It had a fascination for her. But she had not
<i>realized</i> stars, <i>felt</i> stars, as she was to realize them this
night. All the world was shut out from her vision, save
that marvelous dome of sky, alight with myriads and
myriads of stars, from zenith to horizon. She recalled
Milton's description of the floor of heaven, and reveled
in the thought. She gazed on one tremulous star, till
it seemed a soul in space, beckoning to her to join it,
in the company of the glorified. Her vision intensified.
Into the Milky Way she gazed, till it seemed to her the
pathway up to God. God! What was God?</p>

<p>Then the stillness grew till it seemed the Infinite
Presence. The stars, she was sure, made a shining pathway
straight to her. Across the pathway, flashed shooting
stars. She saw it all so clearly. Then the vast
space, up to the shadowy shores of the Infinite Sea, filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
with a strange, unearthly light. God! Was this <i>God</i>?
Then she must be on holy ground! She felt herself
lifted into the Everlasting Arms. The wind rose and
whispered softly. And Esther Bright slept. Who shall
say she did not sleep close to the very heart of God?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>INASMUCH</h3>

<p class="cap">W<span class="smcap">hile</span> the Clayton party were journeying
from Clifton, John Harding was on
guard, vigilant, watchful. In the Post
Office that morning, he chanced to hear
some one repeat a boast Lord Kelwin had
made in regard to Carla Earle, whom he had heretofore
treated with patronizing condescension.</p>

<p>John Harding returned to Clayton Ranch, and invented
excuses to be about the house, saying, as he went
off to do some chores, that if they needed him, just to
call him, adding that he'd be within hearing.</p>

<p>Carla and Edith joked a little about his solicitude, and
went about their daily tasks, planning surprises for
the hungry company, on their return that night. Carla
seemed happier this day than usual, and began to make
a soft music in her throat like the warbling of a bird.
She had been alone in the room for some time, when she
heard a step. She stopped warbling when she recognized
the voice of Lord Kelwin, whom she instinctively
feared.</p>

<p>He had entered the house unannounced, and now
walked into the dining room.</p>

<p>"Aha, my beauty!" he said, stepping toward her.
"Aha, my bird! Caught at last!"</p>

<p>She saw that he was intoxicated.</p>

<p>"So you are alone at last, bird."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
He flung himself between her and the door. Something
in his face filled her with disgust and alarm. He
kept coming towards her, uttering words of insolent
familiarity, and she kept backing away. Finally he
lunged forward, grasped her by the arm, and tried to
hold her. Evidently, he had not counted on opposition
from her; and when he found his will thwarted, all the
beast in him seemed roused. He struck her in the
mouth, calling her vile names as he did so. In an instant,
her shrieks of terror went ringing through the
house. They brought Edith, in sudden alarm, and
John Harding. The latter, recognizing the situation at
a glance, sprang forward, and clutched the Irishman
by the throat.</p>

<p>"Let her go," he said, "you blankety blanked coward.
Let her go, I say!" As he spoke, he gripped Kelwin's
throat tightly, shaking him as if he were a rat. Then he
grew dangerously white.</p>

<p>The visitor, enraged at this unexpected interference,
grew violent. He turned upon Jack Harding, and drew
his gun; but Jack, sober and alert, knocked the
gun from his hand; and, closing with him, dealt terrific
blows in his face. All the brute in the drunken
man roused. The sober man had the advantage. The
struggle lasted but a few moments, though it seemed an
eternity to the frightened girls. Finally, Jack Harding
placed his knees on Kelwin's chest and arms, his
hand on his throat, choking him until he gasped for
mercy. Then the cowboy let him rise. As soon as
he was free, he began to curse Carla Earle. Jack Harding
promptly knocked him down. Partly sobered, the
man rose, and staggered from the room.</p>

<p>Carla stood trembling, her face white with fear.</p>

<p>Harding saw her distress, and said with unusual
gentleness:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't ye care, Miss Carla. 'Tain't so, anyway.
He lied. He'll pay for it."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't meddle with him, I beg you," she said
with sudden alarm. "He might shoot you."</p>

<p>"Shoot? Let him. But he can't insult any decent
woman, while I'm near to protect her. Mark that."</p>

<p>Carla turned to resume her duties, but fell in a limp
heap on the floor. Then Edith and Jack Harding
worked to bring her to. At last her eyes opened. She
looked around, dazed, bewildered. When she realized
what had happened, she asked:</p>

<p>"Has that dreadful man gone?"</p>

<p>On being assured that he was at a safe distance, she
tried to rise, but her knees gave way, and she sank to
the floor again.</p>

<p>So Jack and Edith prepared the evening meal, and
waited. At last they heard the sound of the returning
carriage, and, a few moments later, welcomed the party
at the gate.</p>

<p>When John Clayton heard what had happened, he
seemed dumfounded.</p>

<p>"How dared he? How dared he?" he repeated, indignantly.</p>

<p>But Kenneth's mouth set hard, and it did not augur
well for Lord Kelwin.</p>

<p>For one thing, all were thankful during the ensuing
weeks,&mdash;the Irish nobleman no longer came to Clayton
Ranch, socially, or otherwise. He managed to keep himself
in the background, and was seldom heard of save as
he figured in some drunken brawl. But Jack Harding,
who understood him best of all, and who knew the venom
of his tongue, hounded him day by day. And there
grew up in Lord Kelwin's mind a deepening fear and
hate of Jack Harding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>A WOMAN'S NO</h3>

<p class="cap">M<span class="smcap">iles</span> and miles of desert country, sometimes
a dull red, sometimes almost yellow
of hue; over that a dome of bluest blue;
between the two, air, crystalline, and full
of light; and everywhere, scattered with
reckless profusion, from Nature's lavish hand, the splendor
of cactus blossoms. That is Arizona in June.
And in this glory of color, one June day, walked Mrs.
Clayton and Esther Bright, returning from a round
of neighborhood calls.</p>

<p>As they approached Clayton Ranch, they paused to
admire the cactus blossoms. The giant cactus, towering
above the house, was now covered with a profusion
of exquisite blossoms of deepest pink. Red blossoms,
pink blossoms, white blossoms, yellow blossoms everywhere,
but guarded by thousands of thorns and spines.
Esther stopped and picked some yellow blossoms from
the prickly pear, only to find her fingers stinging from
its minute spines.</p>

<p>"It serves me right," she said, making a wry face.
"I knew better, but I love the blossoms."</p>

<p>"Good evening," called a cheery voice from the
veranda. It was Mr. Clayton.</p>

<p>"Kenneth called to see you, Miss Bright," he continued.
"He would like you to go for a drive with him
this evening."</p>

<p>"Far?" she asked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>"He didn't say."</p>

<p>The two women entered the house, and soon returned
refreshed. On the spacious veranda, the family gathered
in the cool of the day, to feast their eyes on the
gorgeous sunsets.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Esther, "it refreshes me whenever
I <i>look</i> at snow-capped Mt. Graham?"</p>

<p>She looked far away to the south. "I shall miss it
all," she said, pensively, "all the grandeur of scene,
miss all of you here, miss my dear children, when I go
home."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hate to think of your going," said Edith, lifting
the teacher's hand to her cheek. "I'm afraid you
won't come back."</p>

<p>"What's that I hear about not coming back?" asked
Kenneth Hastings, who, at that moment, joined them.</p>

<p>"I said I was afraid Miss Bright wouldn't come
back," explained Edith.</p>

<p>"I hope you are not thinking of going East soon,"
said Kenneth quietly.</p>

<p>When she announced that she should, he protested
vigorously.</p>

<p>That evening, Esther rode with him through beautiful
mountain scenes. The heavens were still colored with
the soft afterglow, as they sped along the upland road.
Later, the moon rose, flooding the earth with its weird,
transfiguring light.</p>

<p>Once more, Kenneth told Esther his past. He wanted
her to know all there was to know, he said simply.</p>

<p>Then he poured into her ears the old, old story, sweetest
story ever told, when love speaks and love listens.
But Esther's eyes were haunted by a sudden fear.</p>

<p>Kenneth paused, and waited for her to speak.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, with a tightening of the lips, he listened to her
answer.</p>

<p>She had not thought of love and marriage. She had
naturally grown into thinking that she would devote
herself to philanthropic work, as her grandfather, before
her, had done.</p>

<p>"Yes," Kenneth said; "but your grandfather married;
and his children married, and you, I take it, are
the joy of his life. Suppose he had not married.
Would his philanthropic work have been greater?"</p>

<p>Then there was more talk, that seemed to give pain
to both, for Esther said:</p>

<p>"I will go soon, and not return; for my presence here
would only make you unhappy."</p>

<p>"No," he urged, "return to Gila.</p>

<p>"You say you regard marriage as very solemn. So
do I. You say you would feel it wrong to marry one
you did not love. So should I."</p>

<p>"I have been candid with you," she said in evident
distress. To which he responded bitterly:</p>

<p>"You think me a godless wretch. Well, I guess I am.
But I had begun to grope after God, and stumbled in
my darkness. I have been beset with tormenting doubts.
The idea of God is so vast I cannot grasp even a
fraction of it. You are right. I am godless."</p>

<p>"No, no, not godless," she said. "Jesus of Nazareth,
what of Him?"</p>

<p>"I am coming to look upon him as a brother. I could
have loved him profoundly, had I known him when he
was on earth. But it all seems so far away in the past.
To tell the truth, I have read the Bible very little."</p>

<p>"Read it," she urged.</p>

<p>"I should feel all the time that religion had placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
a great gulf between you and me, and hate it in consequence.
Ought religion to place a gulf between human
souls?"</p>

<p>"The lack of religion might." Silence followed.
Then she continued, "If I loved you, loved you deeply
enough, that would sweep away all obstacles."</p>

<p>"And perhaps," he added, "if I had always lived
up to the highest ideals of life, I might now be worthy
of you. I <i>am</i> unworthy, I confess it."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't put it that way," she said in distress.
"Let it be that I am not worthy of the love you offer
me, not capable of loving enough to&mdash;to&mdash;marry."</p>

<p>"Miss Bright, you are capable of loving, as few women
are. It is my misfortune that I have not won
your love. I need you to help me live my highest and
best. All these months, because of your unconscious
influence, I have been learning to see myself as I am,
and as I might be. For the first time in my life, I have
come in contact with a deeply religious soul, and have
felt myself struggling towards the light. I have
wrestled with doubt, again and again, bewildered. You
teach us that the founder of the Christian religion had
compassion on sinful men."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But <i>you</i> have no compassion on <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"You misunderstand," she said. "You see it sometimes
happens that there is little real happiness, real
union, where the wife is a believer in God, and the
husband seeks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The devil," supplemented Kenneth. "I confess I
have followed the devil to some extent."</p>

<p>"Don't," she said. "It hurts me to the heart to hear
you speak so. I meant to say if he had no sympathy
with her spiritual life."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>"If I were a professing Christian, do you think you
would care more for me?"</p>

<p>"I might."</p>

<p>"Suppose I pretended to be a Christian. Many make
that pretense, and are accounted the real thing."</p>

<p>"Dear Mr. Hastings, let me be a sincere and loyal
friend to you, no more. Some day, I hope, you will
win, in marriage, some rare woman who will make you
happy."</p>

<p>"Some rare woman? You are that one, Miss Bright.
I want no other."</p>

<p>"But you mustn't think of me, Mr. Hastings."</p>

<p>"Do you know what you are, Miss Bright? You are
an iceberg."</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"That's fortunate. You will not long care for an
iceberg. I will go soon, and you will forget me."</p>

<p>He turned upon her.</p>

<p>"Forget you? Do you really wish me to forget you?"
Did she? She wondered.</p>

<p>"No," she answered. Then over her face, lifted in
the moonlight, he saw the color come.</p>

<p>Their talk drifted to many subjects touching the life in
Gila, and the larger world outside, to which she was
soon to return.</p>

<p>"Will you write to me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That would make it harder for you to forget," she
said, naïvely.</p>

<p>"I do not wish to forget," he said gloomily. "Why
should I forget the happiest hours I have ever spent?"
Why should he?</p>

<p>Back at Clayton Ranch, an older pair of lovers, married
lovers, walked up and down the veranda in the
moonlight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"John," a soft voice was saying, "I just hope Kenneth
will propose to Miss Bright to-night."</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"You women! Always interested in a love story!
How do you know Kenneth hasn't proposed to her
already?"</p>

<p>"I don't believe he has."</p>

<p>Another silence.</p>

<p>"John?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mary."</p>

<p>"Does Miss Bright know what a vast fortune Kenneth
has inherited?"</p>

<p>"No. Not unless you have told her. He does not
wish her to know."</p>

<p>"But, John, that might influence Miss Bright's decision.
You know these Americans care a great deal
for money."</p>

<p>"For shame, Mary, to think such a thing of her!
Perhaps you do not know that her grandfather is a
man of affluence. But he believes in the simple life,
and lives it. She belongs to a fine old family, people
of distinction, and wealth."</p>

<p>"Is that true, John? She never told me. How can
she work like a galley slave here?"</p>

<p>"Because she is a great woman." Silence again.</p>

<p>"With her mind, and heart, and passion for service,
and Kenneth's intellect, and force of character, and vast
wealth, they might be a tremendous force for the progress
of the human race."</p>

<p>"Can't you help matters on, John? I'm so afraid
Miss Bright will reject Kenneth, and leave us."</p>

<p>"Well, if she does, I shall be sorry. But we must
keep hands off."</p>

<p>On the following day, John Clayton was astounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
to hear from Esther that she would not return as she
had half promised to do in the fall.</p>

<p>But Esther offered no explanations; and Kenneth's
calls, from that day, grew less frequent.</p>

<p>So the days passed, and two lives drifted apart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW</h3>

<p class="cap">A<span class="smcap">t</span> the close of the religious service, the following
day, Esther learned of many cases of
sickness, in and about Gila, and especially
along the water courses. A sort of a fever,
the people told her. She resolved to make
neighborhood calls the following day, and to take with
her a case of medicine. She found many people sick
with what seemed to be the same malady; and, thereupon,
began a thorough investigation. The result was
that she persuaded the people to let her call a physician.</p>

<p>On the following day, Dr. Mishell drove into
camp, and Esther made the rounds with him. As she
suspected, the malady proved to be typhoid fever.</p>

<p>"These people must have intelligent care," the physician
said gruffly to her. "Do you know anything
about nursing?"</p>

<p>She told him she had nursed two patients through
typhoid fever.</p>

<p>"You know how to take respiration and temperature,
then?" he said brusquely.</p>

<p>She assured him she did.</p>

<p>Then he wrote out directions for each patient, especially
noting what to do, if certain conditions should
arise.</p>

<p>"You know the importance of sponging patients?"
he asked shortly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Any alcohol?"</p>

<p>"I can get it."</p>

<p>And so Esther Bright was installed head nurse in
Gila. Helpers rallied to her aid.</p>

<p>School was dismissed at an early hour each day, so
that Esther could make the rounds daily.</p>

<p>The heat grew almost intolerable, but the delicate
girl went on her way as if made of iron. Dr. Mishell
looked her over with a nod of approval.</p>

<p>"A woman of sense," he said, in speaking of her to
Kenneth Hastings.</p>

<p>The physician came again in three days, only to find
many new cases. Esther Bright's task was becoming
enormous.</p>

<p>"Can you do it?" the physician had asked. And
quietly she had answered:</p>

<p>"I can do it as long as anyone needs my care."</p>

<p>Again the physician nodded approvingly, and muttered:</p>

<p>"Some women do have some sense."</p>

<p>When this second visit drew to a close, he looked
sharply at Esther, and said in a crusty tone:</p>

<p>"You are working too hard."</p>

<p>She protested.</p>

<p>"I say you <i>are</i>!" he reiterated. "I'm going to find
someone to come help you. Mr. Clayton wishes it. Are
you a Catholic?"</p>

<p>"No, a Quaker."</p>

<p>"Quaker! Quaker!" he repeated. "No objections
to a Catholic, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No objections to any human being who serves humanity."</p>

<p>The old man left her abruptly. As he untied his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
horse, preparatory to leaving, he muttered to himself:</p>

<p>"A very unusual woman. A <i>very</i> unusual woman!"</p>

<p>Late on the following day, when Esther returned
from her rounds, she found the Mexican, who had
come to the Christmas entertainment, awaiting her.
After learning that his Indian wife was sick, she gathered
up her medical outfit, and started with him up the
canyon. It was a long and fatiguing tramp.</p>

<p>The Indian woman proved to be another fever patient.
She refused the medicine, but drank the beef
juice the nurse offered her. After trying to make the
Mexican understand what to do till she came again,
Esther started down the canyon alone.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark. After walking some distance,
she heard the cry of wolves. The cries came nearer.
She quickened her pace to a run, when, catching her foot,
she was thrown violently forward into the stream below.</p>

<p>She struggled to regain her footing, to climb to the
bowlder from which she had fallen; but suddenly discovered
that she had in some way twisted her ankle,
and that she could not bear her weight on that foot.
What was she to do? She was still over a mile from
Clayton Ranch. If she called, no one could hear her.
Oh, those wolves! Their cries sent a chill of terror
through her. Again she struggled to climb up on the
bank, but the bowlder above her was slippery, and there
was nothing to cling to. At last she sent a loud cry
for help echoing down the canyon. Then she listened.
Suddenly she heard a step above her. It was the young
Apache who had visited the school. His coming was
about as welcome to her as the wolves would be.</p>

<p>"Nē-shē-äd-nlĕh´," he said, beckoning her to join
him. She shook her head, pointed to her ankle, and
again tried to climb. Her efforts were futile. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
the Indian lifted her, carried her to a level place,
and set her down. She was unable to bear her weight
on the injured foot, and fell. She pointed to her
ankle, then down towards Gila, hoping the Indian might
make her plight known to the people in camp.</p>

<p>As if in answer to her pantomimic request, he lifted
her easily in his arms, and strode swiftly down the
canyon. Could it be that he had rescued her in order
to return her to her friends? It seemed so.</p>

<p>At last it occurred to her to sing her call for help, to
attract the attention of any miner, or charcoal tender
who might chance to be going up or down the canyon.
So with all the volume she could muster, she sang words,
telling her plight.</p>

<p>Every little while the Apache would repeat the words:</p>

<p>"Nē-shē-äd-nlĕh´."</p>

<p>What could he mean?</p>

<p>About the time Esther was caring for the sick squaw,
Kenneth Hastings learned from Wathemah that the
teacher had gone to the Mexican's shack up the canyon.
He was filled with alarm.</p>

<p>"What's that ye are sayin', Wathemah?" asked Pete
Tompkins, who, passing along, had overheard the conversation.</p>

<p>"Me teacher up canyon. Mexican. Sick squaw,"
replied the child laconically.</p>

<p>"Are you sure, Wathemah?" questioned Kenneth.</p>

<p>The child nodded his head, and pointed toward the
canyon.</p>

<p>"Them devilish Apaches has been about camp all
day," said Pete Tompkins, stopping to speak to Kenneth.
"I seen some of 'em goin' up canyon jest 'fore dark."</p>

<p>"We must go to Miss Bright's rescue at once!" said
Kenneth excitedly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm with ye," said Pete Tompkins. "If a blanked
savage harms that air schoolma'am I'll smash his skull
with the butt o' my gun. I'll jine y'r party. Let's
take all the hounds. We're likely ter run across more'n
one Apache. Hello, kids!" he called out. "Jine a
rescue party. The schoolma'am's went up canyon ter
tend sick squaw,&mdash;the Mexican's woman. Them devilish
Apaches is up through the canyon, an' we're afeared
they'll capture schoolma'am."</p>

<p>Ten well-armed men, some mounted, some unmounted,
started up the canyon. On their way, they met John
Clayton, who joined them. His horse was neck and
neck with Kenneth's.</p>

<p>"Good God!" said the former to his companion.
"What may have happened to Miss Bright? What may
yet happen to her?"</p>

<p>Kenneth made no reply, but his face was tense.</p>

<p>These two men were in advance, closely followed
by Jack Harding and Pete Tompkins, on their Mexican
ponies.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the party heard the distant cry of wolves,
and&mdash;was it a human voice?&mdash;they strained their ears
to hear. It was a human voice, a woman's voice. They
dug their spurs into their horses' sides, and fairly flew.</p>

<p>As they were journeying up the canyon, the savage,
with his captive in his arms, was speeding down the
canyon. Suddenly he turned, and took the trail leading
towards the Apache reservation.</p>

<p>Esther's song for help died on her lips. Every
moment seemed eternity; every step, miles away from
hope of rescue. Then with the energy born of despair,
she sang again so that her song reached the ears of her
rescuers:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Abide with me!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Fast falls the eventide.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The darkness deepens&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Lord, with me abide!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When other helpers fail and comforts flee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Help of the helpless, O, abide with me!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then she listened. Could it be the baying of hounds
she heard? Her heart beat faster. She was not mistaken;
she had heard the hounds. And now she heard the
shouts of men. She began to sing again, but the Indian
pressed his hand over her mouth, and tightening his
hold with his other arm, started to run with her. She
struggled desperately. He held her like a vise. She
screamed for help, as she continued to struggle.</p>

<p>"Courage!" came ringing back in response to her cry.
She knew the voice. It was the voice of Kenneth Hastings.</p>

<p>Again the Apache muttered in her ear:</p>

<p>"Nē-shē-äd-nlĕh´."</p>

<p>She realized that the men were gaining rapidly upon
them, and struggled more violently to free herself.</p>

<p>As the Apache ran, his breath came harder. It was
no easy task to carry his struggling captive, and escape
his pursuers. Still he kept up a remarkable speed.</p>

<p>A moment more, the hounds came upon him. He
kicked desperately, but could not free himself from them.
Then, winding his fingers around Esther's throat, he
choked her, and threw her to the ground. He lifted his
gun, faced his pursuers, and fired. The ball entered
the chest of Kenneth Hastings, who was in hot pursuit,
and nearing the Indian. Kenneth fell from his horse,
and the savage escaped.</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed John Clayton, as he came up.
He sprang from his saddle, and knelt by Kenneth's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
side. A little farther on lay Esther, unconscious. Her
face was ghastly in the dim light, her clothing wet.</p>

<p>"Brandy!" he called. "Any one got brandy?"</p>

<p>"Here," said Pete Tompkins, stepping forward;
"here's a flask."</p>

<p>"With shaking hand, John Clayton tried to staunch the
wound in Kenneth's shoulder. Then he put brandy between
his lips, then between Esther's. She was like ice.</p>

<p>"The brute!" he exclaimed. "I fear he has killed
her!"</p>

<p>Then he pulled off his coat and wrapped it about the
girl, saying as he did so:</p>

<p>"If she is not dead, the warmth may do her good.
Some one ride ahead and prepare Mrs. Clayton."</p>

<p>"I'll go, sir," said a Scotch miner, mounting one of
the ponies.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Tell Mrs. Clayton that Miss Bright and
Mr. Hastings have met with an accident, and both are
unconscious. Tell her to have hot water and blankets
ready."</p>

<p>"Come, John," he said, turning to Jack Harding.
"Just help me lift Miss Bright to my saddle." Mechanically
the cowboy obeyed.</p>

<p>"Can one of you fellows carry Hastings on his horse?"</p>

<p>Jack Harding volunteered.</p>

<p>Few words were spoken by any of the men, as they
made their way back to camp.</p>

<p>Pete Tompkins had noisily boasted that he would kill
the Indian; but, hearing no reply from any one, he subsided.
In spite of his coarseness and vulgarity, he was
touched by the tragic ending of the young teacher's life,
and by the evident sorrow of his companions. He looked
at the still, white face, and something tugged at his
heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>As they passed Keith's house, Mrs. Keith ran out.</p>

<p>"'Ere!" she said. "Wrap 'er in this 'ere warm
shawl."</p>

<p>Wathemah ran after them, asking anxiously:</p>

<p>"Me teacher sick?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very sick, Wathemah," answered Clayton.</p>

<p>Just as they reached the Clayton home, Esther roused,
and said in a dazed way:</p>

<p>"Where am I?"</p>

<p>"You are at home," answered her host, as he carried
her into the house. "Do you feel better?" he asked, as
he laid her on the couch.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" she asked, showing no sign
of recognition.</p>

<p>"We don't know," said Mrs. Clayton, bending over
her.</p>

<p>She moaned.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember the Indian who came to the
schoolhouse?" questioned Mr. Clayton anxiously.</p>

<p>"Indian? Schoolhouse?" she repeated in a perplexed
way. "Where am I?"</p>

<p>"Here with Mrs. Clayton," said her hostess.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Clayton? Who is <i>she</i>?" asked Esther, vacantly.</p>

<p>The group about her exchanged troubled glances.</p>

<p>John Harding was already on his way to the railway
station to telegraph for Dr. Mishell.</p>

<p>Kenneth Hastings, now conscious, was lying on a bed
in the Clayton home. John Clayton bent over him,
staunching the blood the best he could. In the midst of
this, they heard a sharp cry from Esther.</p>

<p>"What is it?" questioned Kenneth.</p>

<p>"Miss Bright!" exclaimed John Clayton, starting
towards the room where the teacher and his wife were.
Returning, he explained that Esther had apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
sprained her ankle, for it was badly swollen, and probably
very painful, when Mrs. Clayton attempted to remove
her shoe.</p>

<p>Kenneth made no response, but, for a while, lay with
eyes closed. He started when John Clayton told him
that, as yet, Esther had not recognized any of the family.</p>

<p>It was a long and anxious night for the ones who
watched. In the morning, when Esther wakened, she
called her companion by name.</p>

<p>"Carla," she said, "I dreamed something dreadful
had happened."</p>

<p>As she spoke, she attempted to rise. A twinge of
pain in her foot stopped her.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You sprained your ankle yesterday," Carla explained.</p>

<p>"Yesterday?" she repeated, in a puzzled way, as if
trying to think of something. "Strange, but I can't
recall yesterday."</p>

<p>"Dr. Mishell is coming to look at your ankle soon."</p>

<p>"Dr. Mishell! Dr. Mishell!" Esther said, slowly.
Then a light came into her face. "Oh, yes! Now I
remember. He came to Gila to see our sick people once,
didn't he? I must dress so as to make the rounds with
him."</p>

<p>So saying, she started again to rise, but sank back
with a pale face.</p>

<p>"My foot, and head, and throat are so painful. It's
so queer. I feel ill, too. What has happened?" she
asked again.</p>

<p>"You were injured, somehow," explained Carla, "and
were unconscious, when found. Mr. Hastings was unconscious,
too."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hastings? Is he here?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And sick?"</p>

<p>"Very. Dr. Mishell and Sister Mercy, the Catholic
sister, are with him now."</p>

<p>"I must help take care of Mr. Hastings, Carla."</p>

<p>"By and by, perhaps," said the girl, soothingly.
"You must get well yourself first."</p>

<p>Kenneth Hastings' condition proved to be more serious
than they thought, and Dr. Mishell looked grave.
He had removed the bullet, and Sister Mercy had assisted
him. When at last the wound was dressed, Dr.
Mishell visited the other patient. He examined her
ankle, and pronounced it a bad sprain. He examined
her head, and looking towards Mrs. Clayton, said:</p>

<p>"It is as you surmised, concussion. Probably due to
a fall."</p>

<p>He gave a few directions to Sister Mercy, and after
a few gruff, but kindly, words, departed, to look after
his other patients in Gila.</p>

<p>Now, Carla Earle began her career as a nurse, and
soon her ministrations were known in every house, and
shack, where fever had entered.</p>

<p>After Esther learned the details of her rescue, and of
how Kenneth Hastings had again risked his life for hers,
she grew abstracted, talked little, and ate less. And
after she had learned that he was critically ill, delirious,
as a result of the wound received in rescuing her, her
sorrow became patent to all. Could she not see him?
But Sister Mercy guarded her patient, and watched, and
prayed the prayers of her church. Physician and nurse
both knew that Kenneth's life hung by a thread. The
sick man talked in his delirium; and his heart story
lodged in the heart of the nurse, who watched by him,
and who nursed him back to life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>When Esther was able to go about on crutches, she
visited her patients who were nearest to Clayton Ranch.
One day Patrick Murphy called on her.</p>

<p>"How are Brigham and Kathleen?" she asked, as she
greeted him. "I hope they are better."</p>

<p>"No betther, Miss," he said, struggling for composure.
"The docther has been lavin' av his midicine, an' Carla
(I mean Miss Earle) has came each day (the saints bliss
her!) but still the faver is bad. An' Brigham&mdash;"</p>

<p>He could say no more. After a while, he continued:</p>

<p>"An' Brigham begs me ter bring yez to him. He insists
upon callin' yez his Christ teacher, ma'am. He
asks ivery day has yez come, an' cries wid disappointmint,
whin he foinds yez are not there. I told him I
would bring yez back wid me if yez could come."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," she promised, "as soon as I speak
to Mrs. Clayton."</p>

<p>When Esther entered the sick room at the Murphy
home, she found two critical cases of typhoid fever.
Their temperature was so high she was filled with alarm.
She questioned the mother closely, as to what had thus
far been done for the children.</p>

<p>"Did you follow the doctor's directions?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, Miss, I didn't think it worth while. Back East
where I wuz riz, they didn't think it necessary ter wash
sick folks with sody an' water every day, an' alkyhol besides.
They jest let sick folks be in peace, an' give 'em a
good washin' after they was corpses."</p>

<p>"But you see, Mrs. Murphy, we must sponge typhoid
patients with water and with alcohol, to lower their temperature.
Brigham's fever is very high."</p>

<p>"I done all I could fur him," sniffled the mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Esther, kindly. "What has he
eaten? Did you give him the beef juice?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, mum. That wuz no eatin' at all. I give him
meat an' potatoes an' cabbage, jest the way he liked 'em
cooked," she said, wiping her eyes on her apron. "He
ain't eat none sence. He jest cries an' cries fur ye,
Miss."</p>

<p>"Brigham is very sick," the teacher said, gently. "He
may not recover. Shall I take care of him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss, I wisht yer would."</p>

<p>Esther called for water and clean linen. She sponged
the children, made the necessary changes, ventilated the
room, and closed the door into the living room; and for
the first time since their illness began, the children had
quiet. The angel of Death hovered near, and the Murphy
family were filled with an indefinable fear.</p>

<p>Esther watched over the two children throughout the
night. Brigham was delirious. Once he seemed terrified,
and called out:</p>

<p>"Mamma, don't hurt my teacher! Wathemah, what
did my teacher tell yer about Jesus? Has my teacher
come?"</p>

<p>At daybreak, when Esther gave him his medicine, he
knew her and smiled. As she bent over him, he said:</p>

<p>"I knowed ye'd come. Is Jesus near?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very near, dear," she answered, softly.</p>

<p>"An' He loves little childern?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, loves them dearly."</p>

<p>"I am so glad." He closed his eyes and seemed smiling
in his sleep. Rousing again, he said in a weak voice:</p>

<p>"I am so tired. Will yer carry me ter Jesus?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>Then tenderly the teacher's arms went around the little
form. She said, aloud:</p>

<p>"Dear Jesus, I have brought you little Brigham, because
you love little children. He is too tired to go any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
farther alone, so I have brought him to you. Please
carry him the rest of the way home."</p>

<p>Gently, she drew her arm away. The child smiled as
if satisfied, and dozed off again.</p>

<p>It was late in the morning, when Dr. Mishell reached
Murphy Ranch. He looked grave as he watched Brigham.</p>

<p>"Better remain here if you can, Miss Bright. Good
nursing will save the girl, and may save the boy; but it
is doubtful. You realize he is in a critical condition."</p>

<p>"Yes. I will remain, Doctor; but Miss Earle will
need help with the other patients."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Earle is doing finely," he assured her.
"And with one exception, none of the cases are as serious
as these two."</p>

<p>"Who is the exception?"</p>

<p>"I believe his name is Clifton. A cowboy by the name
of Harding has gone to his shack, to-day, to nurse him."</p>

<p>"Just like him," she thought.</p>

<p>She made no reply. As the day wore on, Kathleen's
fever decreased, but Brigham's increased. The boy again
grew delirious. He repeatedly called Wathemah and his
teacher. As night drew near, he grew worse. The parents
stood near the bed, weeping. Suddenly the child
cried out:</p>

<p>"Papa, won't yer bring my teacher? She knows the
way ter heaven."</p>

<p>"She's here, lad," he said, taking one of Brigham's
hands in his. Then the father repeated the prayers of
his church.</p>

<p>At dawn, Brigham lifted his arms, and smiled. He
had found the Open Door.</p>

<p>When the Murphy children knew their brother was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
dead, they were filled with awe, and huddled in one corner
of the living room. The mother sobbed aloud, but
refused to come near or touch the still little figure.</p>

<p>The teacher, with tears rolling down her cheeks, prepared
her little friend's body for burial. Then she
spoke again to the father, reminding him of further preparations.
He rose, and, going into the room, where the
family were gathered, said:</p>

<p>"We must have a wake. Poor Brigham."</p>

<p>"No, yer won't have no Cath'lic doin's with Brigham,"
responded his wife.</p>

<p>"Suppose," interposed the teacher, "we have a funeral
service for Brigham in the schoolhouse, among the children
he loved."</p>

<p>"Shure!" responded the father, wiping his eyes,
"that'd be jist the thing."</p>

<p>"Do you approve, Mrs. Murphy?" asked the teacher.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss. That'd please Brigham, I know." And
again she sobbed.</p>

<p>So Brigham was carried to the schoolhouse. The
teacher placed a crucifix at the head of the coffin, and
lighted several candles. It was the first time religious
services for the dead had ever been held in Gila. Heretofore,
the dead had simply been buried.</p>

<p>The schoolroom was filled to its uttermost. The girl
preacher rose and told them of Brigham's lovely life
ever since she had known him, of his interest in Jesus,
and of his desire to know the way to heaven. She told
of his last words, and how he asked her to carry him to
Jesus. As she spoke, tears rolled quietly down the
bronzed cheeks of many a man and woman whose life
had been one long record of sin.</p>

<p>Near the coffin, stood Wathemah, his eyes riveted upon
the face of his little comrade. The teacher saw the child
take off his string of beads and lay it in the coffin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>They buried Brigham on the foothills, and left him
alone;&mdash;no, not alone, for Wathemah remained standing
like a sentinel beside the grave of his little friend.</p>

<p>Wathemah did not return to Mrs. Keith's as usual for
supper. Neither was he in his little bunk that night.
No Wathemah appeared for breakfast. Inquiries began
to be circulated. Where was Wathemah? Esther grew
very uneasy, and started out to search for him herself.
She returned disappointed. An hour later, Jack Harding
returned with the child. He had found him keeping
watch by Brigham's grave. So deep is the Apache's affection,
so real his grief.</p>

<p>Esther gathered Wathemah in her arms, and talked
to him long of Brigham. Henceforth, to that little child,
as to many of his race, the heavens would be full of the
Great Spirit.</p>

<p>"Can Brigham see me from the sky?" asked Wathemah.</p>

<p>"I think so, dear. You'll want to be a good boy,
won't you?"</p>

<p>For answer, he burst into tears, and she mingled her
own with his.</p>

<p>From that time on, Wathemah loved the stars at night,
and would stand watching them with deepening wonder
and awe. Then began his questioning of things eternal,
that upreach of the soul, that links it to the Divine.</p>

<p>The day after Esther's return to Clayton Ranch, Dr.
Mishell asked her to go with him to the shack of Mark
Clifton.</p>

<p>"He cannot recover," he said. "He realizes that. He
has repeatedly asked to see you."</p>

<p>As they approached the shack, they heard a voice.
Jack Harding was reading aloud from the Bible.</p>

<p>On the walls of the shack, were guns, hides, and coarse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
pictures; in one corner, were a case of whiskey bottles,
and a pack of cards. The sick man seemed to be a man
of about thirty. He greeted his visitors courteously, and
at once turned to Esther.</p>

<p>"I have asked to see you," he said. "I think I cannot
recover. I am not prepared to die. I have attended
your meetings since you have held them in the
timber. I believe there is something in your religion;
I believe in God."</p>

<p>His voice was faint.</p>

<p>"Is there any hope for me?" he asked, searching her
face with his keen black eyes.</p>

<p>She shrank from his bold gaze, then answered gently:</p>

<p>"There is hope for every one who repents of his sins
and turns to Christ."</p>

<p>"But," he said, impatiently, "I haven't done so very
much to repent of. I haven't committed any crime,
don't you know? The world doesn't hold such high
ideals of what a fellow ought to be as you do. I am no
better nor worse than the rest of men. I came to that
conclusion long ago."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" She spoke coldly. "Is that all? Then
you do not need me." She rose to go.</p>

<p>"No, it is not all!" interrupted Jack Harding. "Miss
Bright, show him his sin; show him the way of repentance,
as you did me."</p>

<p>Suddenly the cowboy knelt by the bunk, and poured
forth such a heartfelt prayer for the man before him,
all were touched. Clifton lay with eyes closed. Esther
spoke again.</p>

<p>"Mr. Clifton, have you done nothing to repent of?
Think. You lured to this country the sixteen-year-old
orphan daughter of a clergyman. You promised to
marry her, if she would join you here. You placed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
to board in a saloon. You refused to marry her! Thank
God, the child is safe at last!"</p>

<p>There was no mistaking her tone.</p>

<p>"Marry <i>her</i>?" he repeated, contemptuously. "Marry
<i>her</i>? I'd as soon marry a cat. I think too much of my
family. I wouldn't disgrace them by marrying her, the
daughter of a poverty-stricken curate."</p>

<p>Then they saw Esther Bright's eyes flash. Her face
grew as stern as the granite hills of her native state.
She spoke slowly, and each word&mdash;as Dr. Mishell afterwards
said&mdash;seemed to weigh a ton apiece.</p>

<p>"Your family?" she said. "Your family?" she repeated
with scorn. "Your <i>family</i>? This girl is a child
of God!"</p>

<p>And turning, she left the shack.</p>

<p>Jack Harding remained all through the night, talking
and praying, at intervals, with Clifton.</p>

<p>At dawn, the sick man cried out again and again:</p>

<p>"God be merciful to me a sinner!"</p>

<p>Then, at last, he said:</p>

<p>"Jack, I want to atone for my wrong to Miss Earle
as much as I can. I see it all now. Send for a clergyman.
I can't live, I know. If Miss Earle becomes my
wife, it will remove the stigma, and she will inherit a
fortune willed to me. Send for her. Perhaps she will
forgive me, before I die."</p>

<p>At the sunset hour, word passed throughout the
village that Mark Clifton had just died, and that before
his death he had been married to Carla Earle. The
clergyman who attended the dying man wrote to his
parents, telling them of their son's marriage and death,
and of his farewell messages to them. He added:</p>

<p>"Your son died a repentant man."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE</h3>

<p class="cap">O<span class="smcap">n</span> her return from Murphy Ranch, Esther
began to assist in the care of Kenneth Hastings.
As yet, he had not recognized her.
Sometimes, as she sat by him, tears would
gather and roll down her cheeks. One day,
Kenneth opened his eyes and asked:</p>

<p>"Who are you? What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"I am Esther," she answered, "taking care of you."</p>

<p>"No, you're not," he said, wildly. "Get out of
here!"</p>

<p>She stepped back where he could not see her. He
rambled on.</p>

<p>"Some one shot!" He tried to rise. But Sister
Mercy, entering, quieted him, and he lay back, muttering.
Occasionally, Esther caught the words "Esther,"
"gulf," "doubt." About an hour later, he awakened,
quiet. She sat where she could watch his face, and learn
her great lesson.</p>

<p>"Are you an angel?" he asked, with unrecognizing
eyes.</p>

<p>She took one of his hands in hers, and rested her
cheek against it. His hand grew wet with her tears.</p>

<p>"Are you a soul in bliss?" he asked, softly. "I knew
an angel when I was on earth. But a gulf yawned between
us, a gulf, a gulf!"</p>

<p>Then he seemed oblivious of the presence of anyone,
and muttered:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have lost my way&mdash;lost my way,&mdash;lost."</p>

<p>At last he slept again. And Esther Bright, kneeling
by his bedside, with one of his hands clasped in hers,
prayed. Still he slept on. When he awakened, John
Clayton stood looking down upon him. Kenneth looked
around, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Well, John! Where am I?"</p>

<p>"Here in my home. Are you feeling better, Kenneth?"</p>

<p>"Better? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You've been very sick, and delirious. But now
you'll recover."</p>

<p>"What was the matter?"</p>

<p>"An Indian blackguard shot you through the shoulder.
Septic conditions set in, and you had a high fever.
Keep still there," he said, as he prevented his friend
from moving.</p>

<p>"Queer, John," said Kenneth, after a moment's pause.
"I can't recall anything that has happened recently but
a drive with Miss Bright just before she went away.
But I can't speak of that&mdash;"</p>

<p>And Esther Bright, resting on the couch in the living
room, heard every word. A long silence followed.</p>

<p>"John," said Kenneth in a low voice, "tell her sometime
for me, that I have lived a clean, honorable life.
You know I have gone to the saloons here sometimes,
largely because other human beings were there. You
know I gambled a little to kill time. So deucedly lonely!
Tell her I wasn't bad at heart."</p>

<p>He started to say more, but suddenly stopped. And
Esther, hearing in spite of herself, searched her own
heart.</p>

<p>Dr. Mishell came the next day, and finding his patient
delirious again, announced that he would stay with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
him till danger was past. So the physician and nurse
again watched together.</p>

<p>It was the day Esther was to have left for Massachusetts.
When questioned as to the time of her departure,
she now assured everyone she would stay till her sick
people were well.</p>

<p>While Dr. Mishell sat by Kenneth, Mr. Clayton found
Esther on the veranda, in tears. He pretended not to
see.</p>

<p>"Does Dr. Mishell give any hope of Mr. Hastings'
recovery?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. There has been a decided change for the better
this past hour."</p>

<p>He slipped his hand under her arm, and, together,
they walked up and down the path to the road.</p>

<p>"My dear friend," he said to her, "Kenneth <i>may</i>
die, but I know a powerful restorative, that might help
to save his life, if we could only bring it to him." He
knew her heart better than Kenneth did.</p>

<p>"Oh, let <i>me</i> take it to him," she said eagerly. "I'd
be so thankful to have a chance to help save his life.
He's done so much for me, and he is such a loyal&mdash;friend."</p>

<p>"You shall be the one to bring him the medicine if
you will," he said smiling.</p>

<p>"What is it? Where can I get it?" she asked, eager
to go on her errand of mercy.</p>

<p>"Where can you get it?" he repeated. "You can
find it in your own heart. It is love that will save Kenneth,
dear Miss Bright."</p>

<p>Her tears fell fast.</p>

<p>"I fear I have made him very unhappy," she said.</p>

<p>"I suspect you have," he responded.</p>

<p>"Did he tell you so?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. You know he has been delirious from the first.
In his delirium, he has talked of you constantly."</p>

<p>At last danger was past, and nurse and physician
assured the Clayton household that Kenneth Hastings
would recover.</p>

<p>He awakened from sleep, alone. As he opened his
eyes, they fell upon a copy of Tennyson's works. It was
open at "The Princess." Someone had been reading,
and marking passages. He at once turned to the title
page, and at the top, read a name he half expected to see.
Could it be possible that she was still there? He looked
around the room. By his bedside, stood a small round
table, on which stood a low glass dish, filled with pink
cactus blossoms. Near by, was an open Bible. Here,
too, was a marked passage,&mdash;"faith, hope, love, these
three; but the greatest of these is love," He knew the
Bible was Esther's. He laid it down, as though he had
trespassed upon her innermost heart. He closed his
eyes, and lay in a half-dream of possible joy. Over and
over, the words seemed to repeat themselves,&mdash;"the
greatest of these is love." There was a quiet step, and
Esther entered, looking fresh and cool in a white dimity
gown. In her hands, was a bunch of cactus flowers. She
laid them down, and with a joyous cry went to him,
clasping his hand in hers.</p>

<p>"You know me at last?" she asked. "I am so glad!"</p>

<p>Kenneth did not speak. She continued, "I feared
you would never know me again." She seemed to hesitate
a moment, but went on. "I feared I could never
tell you what I now <i>know</i>, what I want to tell you."</p>

<p>"What do you know?" he asked. "What do you
wish to tell me?"</p>

<p>"That I love you," she answered, and stooping down,
she put her cheek against his.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look out, Kenneth!" she said, warningly, with a
happy little laugh. "You mustn't forget about the
wound in your shoulder."</p>

<p>But he held her captive.</p>

<p>"What do I care for the wound in my shoulder, when
the wound in my heart is healed?" he asked of her.</p>

<p>"I came to heal the wound I made in your heart,"
she said, while a pink wave swept over her face.</p>

<p>Still he held her, drawing her closer to him.</p>

<p>"The lips," he said, "on the lips, as a penance."</p>

<p>"My penance is easy," she said with a happy ring
in her voice.</p>

<p>Then drawing a chair close to the side of his bed, she
let him gather her hands in his.</p>

<p>"Strange!" he said. "During my illness I dreamed
it would be this way. I must have dreamed a long time.
You were always with me, I thought. You were always
in white, and often brought me flowers. Once, I found
myself in heaven. You met me, and smiled and said,
'Come.' You brought me the most heavenly being I
ever beheld, and placing my hand in his, said significantly,
'He loved much!' Then you vanished. And the
heavenly being smiled upon me. And my heart grew
glad. I began to understand the mysteries of life.
Then I thought how you had led me to the very fountain
of love, that I might know how to love you purely.
I began to feel I could renounce all my hopes of your
love, because there was something in that other presence
that taught me that great Love asks no return.
It just loves on, and on. Then I thought this heavenly
being called me brother. And thousands of voices began
to sing, 'Glory to God in the highest!'"</p>

<p>"Beautiful!" she said.</p>

<p>"Then I seemed to float in space, and I knew that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
were near me. Your arms were full of flowers, and you
offered up silent prayers for me that bridged the gulf
between us."</p>

<p>She kissed him again, saying softly:</p>

<p>"Beloved, I did bridge the gulf with prayers. How
stupid I was not to know sooner!"</p>

<p>"Not to know what?"</p>

<p>"Not to know love when it came."</p>

<p>"But you know it now, Beloved?" he said, drawing
the hands he clasped nearer to himself. "I thank God
for that."</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, and lay very still, still clasping her
hands. She watched by him. At last, his hands relaxed
their hold, and she knew by his regular breathing
that he was asleep.</p>

<p>John Clayton came to the door, saw how it was, and
went away. So did the others who came to inquire.
And Kenneth slept on, a restful, restoring sleep. And
as Esther watched, she repeated to herself:</p>

<p>"The Greatest of These is Love."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<h3>AT SUNSET</h3>

<p class="cap">I<span class="smcap">t</span> was Dr. Mishell speaking.</p>

<p>"My dear young lady, if Mr. Hastings must go
to England, as he says he must, he should not go
alone. He needs care. I have recommended you
as a competent nurse." His eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"Is it <i>safe</i> for him to travel now?" asked Esther.</p>

<p>"If he makes the journey by slow stages."</p>

<p>The physician spoke with some hesitation.</p>

<p>"At any rate he should get out of this intense heat
as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"But the ocean voyage," she suggested.</p>

<p>"Probably do him good."</p>

<p>The physician had already extended his congratulations
to them. Before leaving, he gripped Kenneth's
hand, and said heartily:</p>

<p>"My nurse will be a helpmate to you. She is a woman
of sense."</p>

<p>While he still gripped Kenneth's hand, he turned to
Esther, and extended his other hand to her. He placed
her hand in Kenneth's, and said impressively:</p>

<p>"'What <i>God</i> hath joined together, let not man put
asunder.' Miss Bright, you are to marry a true man.
Always <i>trust</i> him."</p>

<p>His eyes filled. He turned abruptly and was gone.</p>

<p>Poor Dr. Mishell!</p>

<p>The wilting heat of August was upon them.</p>

<p>At evening, Esther, wearied with packing trunks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
joined Kenneth on the veranda. As she sat there,
Wathemah ran to her, and flung a bunch of flowers in
her lap.</p>

<p>"Why do you leave me?" he asked.</p>

<p>She put her arm about him, and told him she was
going home, a long, long way from there, and that Mr.
Hastings was going with her.</p>

<p>"Wathemah go, too?" he asked.</p>

<p>Both laughed.</p>

<p>"No, little chap," she said, drawing him closer to
her, "not this time."</p>

<p>"Wathemah go, too," he said, reproachfully, looking
at Kenneth with marked disapproval.</p>

<p>"Do you love your teacher?" asked Kenneth. He,
too, liked the child.</p>

<p>Wathemah nodded.</p>

<p>"Would you like to be her boy, and live with her
always?"</p>

<p>Wathemah placed one arm about his teacher's neck,
and said softly:</p>

<p>"Wathemah's mother!"</p>

<p>Kenneth laughed again, and declared he was jealous.</p>

<p>Then Esther told the little fellow she would come back
to Gila and get him, and he should then go to live with
her always.</p>

<p>"Take me now," he urged.</p>

<p>"No, dear," she said.</p>

<p>With that, he sprang from her, and walked proudly
out of the yard, on toward the canyon, without turning,
or looking back.</p>

<p>"A nugget of gold from the Rockies," said Kenneth,
looking after him.</p>

<p>"An Arizona cactus," she replied, "lovely, but hard
to handle."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>Wathemah trudged up the canyon, to his favorite
bowlder, where he went, often, to listen to the waters.
There, he threw himself down, and cried himself to
sleep. He had slept a half-hour, perhaps, when he was
awakened by voices.</p>

<p>"Why, here's Wathemah," called out Jack Harding.</p>

<p>Another spoke, "He's a queer un. He never will be civilized."</p>

<p>The group of cowboys gathered about the child.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, sonny?" asked his friend, Jack
Harding.</p>

<p>Then he told them of his teacher's refusal to take him
with her.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, little kid!" said Jack. "Here, boys, let's
give him money ter go home with Miss Bright. I'll
jest ask her ter take him along with her, an' I'll pay
fur his keep. Don't cry, sonny. It's all right. Down
in y'r pockets, pards, an' fork out some money fur
Wathemah. We saved him, an' raised him, yer know."</p>

<p>His own hand went down into his pockets, and into
his hat went a roll of bills. He passed his hat, and soon
it was full of bills and silver dollars.</p>

<p>That evening, it began to be whispered about that
Wathemah was to go with Miss Bright. But of this
rumor she knew nothing.</p>

<p>Two days later, the hands of young men and maidens
were busy decorating the Clayton home for the wedding
of Esther Bright and Kenneth Hastings. Cactus blossoms
of exquisite form and color were used. Not only
the interior of the house, but the veranda and yard as
well, were one glorious mass of color.</p>

<p>Jack Harding worked faithfully, stopping now and
then to talk with Kenneth, who lay on a couch on the
veranda.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>Carla, too, was busy, putting artistic touches here
and there. She, too, came often to the sick man's side.</p>

<p>But Esther was forbidden to work, and when she
persisted, Mr. Clayton captured her and took her off
for a ride. She was to be married at sunset.</p>

<p>While they were out driving, one of John Clayton's
cowboys drove up from the station, bringing David
Bright and an English clergyman, a friend of Kenneth's,
with him.</p>

<p>When Esther returned, and found her grandfather,
her joy knew no bounds.</p>

<p>"I wish now, Kenneth, that we were to marry ourselves,
as Friends do," she said, "but grandfather can
give me away."</p>

<p>The guests who had been bidden, gathered in the yard,
just as the glory of the sunset began. There was Bobbie,
with the Carmichaels; there were some of the cowboys
and cowlasses, miners and ranchers who had attended
the meetings; all the Clayton household; Dr.
Mishell and Sister Mercy, Miss Gale, and Wathemah
were there. Jack Harding kept a close watch on Wathemah,
not knowing just what he might do.</p>

<p>As the sun neared the horizon, the clergyman took
his place in the yard, Kenneth stepped forward, and
waited. Esther Bright, in a sheer white gown, freshly
laundered,&mdash;a gown she had worn many times as she had
ministered to the sick, came forward on the arm of her
stately old grandfather, who gave her away. His benign
face seemed to hallow the hour.</p>

<p>The colors in the sky seemed to vie with the cactus
blossoms. Yellows, and violets, and deep crimson, faint
clouds with golden edges, violet, then rose-colored, all
melting into the dome of the sky.</p>

<p>The man and the woman were repeating the marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
ritual of the Church of England, while this miracle of
beauty flashed through the heavens.</p>

<p>The plaintive cry of the mourning dove rang out, followed
by the cheerful piping of a cardinal.</p>

<p>The human voices went on with the solemnest vows
man and woman may speak.</p>

<p>The exquisite notes of the cardinal, then of a thrush,
accompanied their voices. The beauty of the dying day
played over Esther Bright and Kenneth Hastings, as
they stood in the glory of their youth, and of their love.</p>

<p>Just as the clergyman pronounced the closing words
of the marriage service, the heavens leaped into a splendor
of color; a mocking bird caught up all the songs
that had furnished an obligato to the marriage service;
and, as if to outdo all the other feathered songsters,
burst into a perfect ecstasy of song.</p>

<p>In the midst of the congratulations and feasting,
Wathemah kept close to Esther's side.</p>

<p>The following day, Kenneth, Esther and David Bright
were to begin their long journey eastward. The day
dawned. All Gila gathered at the distant station to
bid them God speed.</p>

<p>"Where is Wathemah?" Esther asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered a miner. "I found him
cryin' 'cause yer wouldn't take him with yer."</p>

<p>"Poor little chap! But where's Jack?" she questioned.</p>

<p>"There they be," said a ranchman, pointing to Jack
and Wathemah, standing apart from the crowd. She
stepped toward them.</p>

<p>"I have come to say good-by," she said. "You
won't forget, Jack, to follow the Christ; you won't forget
to pray?"</p>

<p>She laid her hand on his arm. He stood battling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
with himself. Her tender voice, her eyes filled with
tears, almost unmanned him.</p>

<p>"Is it not much, do yer think, ter let yer go, as have
brought me ter know God, as have learned me ter live
right, an' have been like God's angel ter me? God help
me!" The strong man's face worked, and he turned
from her. After a moment, he put his hand in his
pocket, and drew forth the Bible she had given him.</p>

<p>"I wisht I'd a knowed about this when I was a lad.
My life'd ben differnt. I thank yer fur all yer've done
fur me, and all yer've learned me. But it seems I can't
let yer go. God help me!"</p>

<p>He stood with head bent and hands clinched.</p>

<p>At last, Esther spoke again:</p>

<p>"Good-by, John. You have fought a good fight, and
conquered. Now, help the others with all your might."
Ah, how much she had helped him in his battle!</p>

<p>He grasped her hand and held it. So they stood.
Then he said:</p>

<p>"Take the little kid with yer. Give him a chance.
I'll send him money as long as I live. I ain't got nobody
else ter care fur."</p>

<p>She would help the strong man, now, if she could; but
how could she? He had this battle to fight alone.</p>

<p>"You wish <i>me</i> to take Wathemah, John?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Give him a chance,&mdash;differnt surroundings."</p>

<p>He lifted a bag of money.</p>

<p>"This 'ere holds nearly one hunderd dollars. The
boys give it to Wathemah ter go home with yer."</p>

<p>"Did they? How generous!"</p>

<p>The child ran to her, fearful he should be left behind.
She hesitated. How could she care for her convalescent
husband, and this impetuous, high-strung child?
She turned to Kenneth and spoke with him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>Jack lifted Wathemah in his arms and kissed him,
saying:</p>

<p>"Good-by, little pard. Mind now, no more cussin'."</p>

<p>David Bright, who had overheard the conversation,
now stepped forward, and said, "Let the child go with
us, Esther, if those who have reared him consent."</p>

<p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Keith, who stood near him, signified
their willingness. The party then entered the
Pullman, and a few minutes later, the train drew out
from the station.</p>

<p>Esther and Wathemah went to the rear platform, and
watched till a turn in the road hid their friends from
their sight. After a time Kenneth joined them.</p>

<p>"Tears, Esther?" he said, lifting her face.</p>

<p>"But not of sorrow," she returned.</p>

<p>He put an arm around each, and they stood looking
down upon the majesty of the scene through which they
were passing.</p>

<p>One looking back to that moment, would say it had
been prophetic of the future. The man of power, destined
to become a determining factor in the development
of the great Southwest; the woman at his side, great
of heart and brain and soul; and this little prince of
the Rockies, with his splendid heritage of courage,
destined to be the educational leader of his race. And it
was this woman of vision, who, during the years that
were to come, saw clearly the great work her husband
and foster son might do, and nerved them for it by her
faith in the work, and their power to do it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<h3>AFTERMATH</h3>

<p class="cap">I<span class="smcap">t</span> was a substantial stone house, built against the
mountainside, overlooking a picturesque canyon.
A woman sat on the broad veranda. Occasionally,
she turned her head, and looked down the mountain
road, listening as though expecting some one.
Then she walked down the path, and stood watching.
A little five-year-old girl joined her, flitting about like
a sprite.</p>

<p>"Will father come soon, mother?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I hope so, Edith. He said he would come to-day."
There was a far away look in the mother's eyes.</p>

<p>"Why <i>doesn't</i> father come?" the child continued.</p>

<p>"Oh, he has been a long way, and has traveled many
days, dear. Something may have happened to detain
him."</p>

<p>"What could have happened, mother?" the little one
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, business, or the rails might have spread, or there
might have been a washout, or a landslide."</p>

<p>The mother again looked down the road. Then she
walked slowly back to the veranda and took up her sewing.
The child leaned against her knee.</p>

<p>"Mother, when you were a little girl, did you have
any little girls to play with?"</p>

<p>"No. I had just my dear grandfather."</p>

<p>"Then you know how lonely I am, mother. It's
pretty hard to be a little girl and all alone."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you think you are alone, little daughter, when
you have father, and aunt Carla, and mother?"</p>

<p>"But you are big, mother, don't you see? When a
little girl hasn't any other little boys and girls to play
with, the world's a pretty lonesome place."</p>

<p>The mother sighed.</p>

<p>The child rested her chin in her dainty hands, and
looked up through her long lashes into her mother's
eyes.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking, mother."</p>

<p>The child was given to confidences, especially with her
mother.</p>

<p>"What did you think, Edith?" The mother smiled
encouragingly.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd pray for a brother."</p>

<p>A tear trembled on the mother's cheek.</p>

<p>"A little brother?" The mother looked far away.</p>

<p>"Oh, a <i>b-i-g</i> brother!" said the child, stretching her
arms by way of illustration.</p>

<p>"What would you say, sweetheart, if a big brother
should come to-day?"</p>

<p>The little one clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"A really, <i>truly</i>, big brother?" she asked, dancing
about in glee.</p>

<p>"A really, truly, big brother,&mdash;Wathemah. You have
never seen him, and he has never seen you, since
you were a baby. But he is coming home soon, you
know."</p>

<p>"Will he play with me?" she asked. "You and
Aunt Carla just 'nopolize father and the big ladies and
gentlemen when they come. But <i>sometimes</i> father plays
with me, doesn't he, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sometimes. He loves his little daughter."</p>

<p>"I don't know." She shook her head doubtfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>"I heard father say he loved you bestest of ev'rybody
in a world."</p>

<p>She threw up her arms and gave a little jump.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish I had some one to play with!"</p>

<p>"Let's go watch for father again," said the mother,
rising.</p>

<p>This time they were not disappointed. They heard
the sound of wheels; then they saw the father. The
little daughter ran like the wind down the road. The
father stopped the horses, gave the reins to the driver,
and stepped to the ground. In an instant the little
sprite was in his arms, hugging him about the neck,
while her ripples of laughter filled the air. The wife
approached, and was folded in the man's embrace.</p>

<p>"Father," said the child, "I am to have a big brother,
mother says."</p>

<p>"You are?" Great astonishment.</p>

<p>The parents smiled.</p>

<p>"An', father,"&mdash;here she coquetted with him&mdash;"you
and mother are not to 'nopolize him when he comes.
He's going to play with me, isn't he, mother?"</p>

<p>"I think so." A grave smile.</p>

<p>The child was given to saying her father "un'erstood."</p>

<p>"When did you hear from Wathemah, Esther?" the
father asked.</p>

<p>"About ten days ago. I'll read you his letter. I
shall not be surprised to see him any day, now."</p>

<p>"Wathemah is my big brother, Father. Mother said
so. She says he's always been my big brother, only <i>I</i>
didn't re'lize it, you know."</p>

<p>The parents looked amused.</p>

<p>"Yes, Edith, he is your brother, and a dear brother,
too," said the father.</p>

<p>When they were seated on the veranda, and the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
was perched on her father's knee, Esther brought Wathemah's
last letter, and read it aloud to her husband.</p>

<p>"<i>Dear Mother Esther:</i></p>

<p>"This is probably the last letter I shall write you from
Harvard for some time. As soon as Commencement is
over, I shall go to Carlisle again for a brief visit, and
then start for Arizona, to Father Kenneth and you, my
dear Mother Esther, and my little sister and Carla and
Jack. Now that the time approaches for me to return
to you, I can hardly wait.</p>

<p>"I may have expressed my gratitude to you and
Father Kenneth in different ways before, but I wish
to do so again now.</p>

<p>"I am deeply indebted to him for his generosity, and
for his fatherly interest and counsel. But it is to you,
my beloved teacher, I owe most of all. All that I am
or ever may be, I owe entirely to you. You found me
a little savage, you loved me and believed in me, and
made it possible for me to become a useful man. As I
have grown older, I have often wondered at your patience
with me, and your devotion to the interests of the
Indian. You have done great things already for him,
and I am confident that you will do much more to bring
about a true appreciation of him, his character and
his needs. The Indian in transition is a problem. You
know more about that problem than almost anyone
else.</p>

<p>"I never told you about my birthday, did I? Do you
know the day I count my years by? My first day, and
your first day at the Gila school. Then my real birth
took place, for I began to be a living soul.</p>

<p>"So, in a spiritual sense, you are my real mother.
I have often wondered if the poor creature who bore
me is still living, and living in savagery. All a son's
affection I have given to you, my beloved foster mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
It is now nearly sixteen years since you found me a
little savage. I must have been about six years of age,
then; so, on the next anniversary of your first day in
the Gila school, I shall be twenty-two years old. From
that day till now, you have been the dearest object in
the world to me. I am sure no mother could be more
devotedly loved by her son than you are loved by
me. I strive to find words to express the affection in
my heart.</p>

<p>"And Grandfather Bright! How tender and gentle
he always was to me, from the time we had our beautiful
wedding journey until his death! He came to Carlisle
to see me as he might have gone to see a beloved son.
He always seemed to me like God, when I was a little
fellow. And as I grew older, he became to me the
highest ideal of Christian manhood. I went over to
Concord Cemetery not long ago, and stood with uncovered
head by his grave.</p>

<p>"And our dear little David Bright! That was a sore
loss for you and Father Kenneth.</p>

<p>"You don't know how often I wish to see little Edith.
I was greatly disappointed that you and Father Kenneth
did not bring her with you the last time you came to
see me. You didn't realize such a lean, lanky, brawny
fellow as I cared so much to see a little girl, did you?
I had always wished I might have a little sister. I have
shown her pictures to some of the fellows who come to
my room, telling them she is my baby sister. They
chaff me and say I do not look much like her.</p>

<p>"The fellows have been very courteous to me.</p>

<p>"Now that the time has come to leave Harvard and
Cambridge and Boston, I am sorry to go. I have met
such fine people.</p>

<p>"Dr. &mdash;&mdash; urges me to return in the fall, to continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
my work for my Master's degree; but I have thought
it all over, and believe it wiser, for the present, to work
among my people, and get the knowledge I seek at first
hand. After that, I'll return to Harvard.</p>

<p>"Long ago, your words gave me my purpose in life,&mdash;to
prepare myself to the uttermost for the uplift of my
race.</p>

<p>"Daily, I thank you in my heart, for the years I had
at Carlisle. But most of all, I thank you for yourself
and what you have been to me.</p>

<p>"I must not close without telling you of a conversation
I had with Col. H&mdash;&mdash; of Boston. He heard your
address on 'The Indian in Transition' at the Mohonk
Conference. He told me it was a masterly address, and
that you presented the Indian question with a clearness
and force few have done. He told me that what you
said would give a new impulse to Indian legislation.
He seemed to know of your conferences at Washington,
too.</p>

<p>"I hear great things of Father Kenneth, too; his increasing
wealth, his power for leadership, and his upright
dealings with men.</p>

<p>"Do you remember how jealous I used to be of him
when I was a little chap? Well, I am jealous no longer.
He is the finest man I know.</p>

<p>"But I must stop writing. This letter has run on
into an old-fashioned visit.</p>

<p>"I am coaching one of the fellows in mathematics.
Strange work for a savage!</p>

<p>"With love for all of you, including my dear Carla,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">"Your loving boy,</span>
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">"<span class="smcap">Wathemah.</span>"</span><br />
</p>

<p>"He's a fine fellow, is Wathemah," said Kenneth,
as he cuddled his little girl up in his arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, he's developed wonderfully," responded Esther.</p>

<p>"How's Carla?" the husband asked.</p>

<p>"Carla's well, and just now deeply interested in the
Y.M. and Y.W.C.A. work."</p>

<p>Here Carla herself appeared, and joined in the welcome
home. She was the picture of wholesome content.</p>

<p>While they were talking, there was a sound of wheels
again. The wagon stopped, a young man jerked out a
trunk, paid the driver, and ran towards the veranda.
How happy he seemed!</p>

<p>"It's Wathemah," all cried, hastening to meet him.
The sprite was in advance, with arms outstretched.</p>

<p>"I guess you don't reco'nize me," she said. "I'm
your little sister."</p>

<p>He laughed, stooped and lifted her in his arms, and
kissed her several times.</p>

<p>Then came Esther's turn. At the same time, Kenneth
enfolded Wathemah. Then came Carla, whom Wathemah
kissed as he used to do in childhood days, and laughingly
repeated a question he was accustomed to ask her
then&mdash;"Is my face clean, Carla?"</p>

<p>And all laughed and talked of the days when they had
found one another, of the Claytons and Jack Harding,
and Patrick Murphy and his family, and the Rosses and
Carmichaels, and the changes that had taken place in
Gila since they left there.</p>

<p>"I was so sorry to hear of Mr. Clayton's death," said
Wathemah. "What a great-hearted man he was! Such
a generous friend! Do you suppose Mrs. Clayton and
Edith will ever come back to America?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Kenneth, "I fear not. Mrs. Clayton's
kindred are in England, you know. She never
liked America. It was a lonely life for her here, and
doubly so after her husband's death."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>"And how's Jack? Dear old Jack! I must see him
soon," said Wathemah.</p>

<p>"I'll call him up," said Kenneth, going to the phone.</p>

<p>"Give me 148, please."</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;1-4-8."</p>

<p>"Hello! Is Mr. Harding within reach?"</p>

<p>"Gone to the store, you say? Send some one for him
at once, please, and tell him Mr. Hastings wishes to talk
with him. Important."</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver and returned to his place.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Father Kenneth, I have received a
letter from Jack every week since I left Gila, except the
time he was sick? He insisted upon sending me money,
saying that it was he who found me, and wanted me to
live."</p>

<p>"Yes, Jack is a generous fellow," assented Kenneth.</p>

<p>"I tried to make him understand that I was strong
and able to earn my own way; but it made no difference."</p>

<p>"Just like him! Bless him!" said Esther.</p>

<p>"So I have invested his money for him, in his name,
and it will make him very comfortable some day."</p>

<p>Kenneth smiled.</p>

<p>"Jack is becoming a rich man by his own work, and
his own wise investments."</p>

<p>Just then the telephone rang.</p>

<p>"Hello! Hello! Is that you, Jack?" asked Kenneth.</p>

<p>"That's good.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes.</p>

<p>"Something interesting is up. Whom would you like
to see at this moment?</p>

<p>"Mother Esther? That's good. Who next?</p>

<p>"Wathemah? Hold the phone a minute."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>He turned to Wathemah.</p>

<p>"Jack says he'd like to see you. He doesn't know
you're here. Here! Talk to him yourself."</p>

<p>So Wathemah stepped to the phone.</p>

<p>"Hello, old Jack!"</p>

<p>There was a happy laugh.</p>

<p>"You'll be over to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"What's that you say? <i>Your</i> boy? Well, I guess!"</p>

<p>"How happy Jack will be!" said Kenneth.</p>

<p>"Your little pard?" There was a chuckle from the
lithe, muscular young Indian.</p>

<p>"To be sure, I'm still your 'pard,' only I'm far from
little now. I'm a strapping fellow."</p>

<p>"What's that? You feel the education has come between
us? No more o' that, old fellow! You're one
of the biggest-hearted friends man ever had!"</p>

<p>"Tell him to come over as soon as he can," interrupted
Kenneth.</p>

<p>"Father Kenneth says 'Come over as soon as you
can.'"</p>

<p>"You will? Good! What a reunion we'll have!
Good-by."</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver, and the conversation drifted
on.</p>

<p>"Has Jack made a successful overseer?" questioned
Wathemah.</p>

<p>"Very. He's a fine fellow. He is still very religious,
you know, and the men respect him. He has become
an indefatigable reader and student of labor questions.
Recently I heard him give a speech that surprised
me. He grasps his subject, and has a direct way
of putting things."</p>

<p>"I should expect Jack to be a forceful speaker," commented
Wathemah, "if he ever overcame his diffidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
so as to speak at all. But tell me about the school at
Gila. That little spot is dear to me."</p>

<p>"You should see the building there now," said Esther.
"Do you know that the people who were most
lawless when we were there, are now law-abiding citizens?
Gila is said to be one of the best towns in Arizona."</p>

<p>"That seems like a miracle,&mdash;your miracle, Mother
Esther." He rose from his chair and stood for a moment
behind her, and said in a low voice, as in childhood,
"<i>Me</i> mother, <i>me</i> teacher." There was a suspicious
choke in his voice, and, turning, he lifted Edith,
tossed her to his shoulder, and ran with her down toward
the road. Kenneth overtook him, and as they strolled
along, they talked of many things, but chiefly of Esther,
and her great work for the Indian.</p>

<p>"How did it all come about?" asked Wathemah.</p>

<p>"Oh, in a roundabout way. Her magazine articles on
the Indian first drew attention to her. Then her address
at the Mohonk Conference brought her into further
prominence. She was asked to speak before the Indian
Commission. Later, she was sent by the Government
to visit Indian schools, and report their condition.
She certainly has shown marked ability. The more she
is asked to do, the more she seems capable of doing."</p>

<p>"A wonderful woman, isn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Vital. What she has done for the Indian, she
has also done for the cause of general education in Arizona."</p>

<p>"I fear she will break down under all this, Father
Kenneth."</p>

<p>"Never fear. Work is play to her. She thinks rapidly,
speaks simply, and finds people who need her absorbingly
interesting."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, but she gives herself too much to others," protested
the Indian youth.</p>

<p>"Well, we must let her. She is happier so," responded
Kenneth.</p>

<p>"What about your own work, Father Kenneth? I
have heard in Massachusetts that you are a great force
for public good throughout this region. But tell me of
the mines."</p>

<p>"I invested much of my fortune <i>here</i>," said Kenneth,
giving a broad outward sweep of his arm. "Some of
the mines are paying large dividends. My fortune has
more than doubled. But Arizona has been unfortunate
in being infested with dishonest promoters. I am trying
to bring about legislation that will protect people
from this wholesale robbery."</p>

<p>"I suspect you enjoy the fight," laughed the youth.</p>

<p>"It has created bitter enemies," said Kenneth,
gravely.</p>

<p>So talking, they again sought the house, and found
Esther and Carla on the veranda. The latter sat where
Wathemah could see her delicate profile as she bent over
some sewing. Quiet happiness and content had transformed
her into a lovely woman.</p>

<p>"How beautiful you are, Carla!" said Wathemah, admiringly.</p>

<p>He enjoyed her confusion.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the day I played truant, Carla,
and you found me in the canyon, and made me ashamed
of myself?"</p>

<p>Did she?</p>

<p>He did not notice the shadow over the winsome face.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Wathemah," said Esther, "Carla
would not remain at college, because she felt I needed
her. But she has become an indefatigable student."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>Later, Wathemah discovered for himself that she really
had become a fine student. One day he asked her how
she came to study Greek.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, hesitatingly, "I loved Grecian literature,
and history, and art. And I had often heard that
my father was a fine Greek scholar. So I began by myself.
Then I had Sister Esther help me. And after
that, it became to me a great delight."</p>

<p>They were a merry party that day. All were in fine
spirits. In the midst of their talk and laughter, the telephone
rang.</p>

<p>"Some one for you, Esther," said Kenneth, returning
to the veranda.</p>

<p>On her return, he looked up questioningly.</p>

<p>"The superintendent of education wishes me to give
an address before the teachers at Tucson next month,"
she said, quietly.</p>

<p>"And will you do it?" asked Wathemah.</p>

<p>"Do it?" echoed Kenneth. "Of course she'll do it!
She doesn't know how to say 'no.'"</p>

<p>Esther smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>"You see, Wathemah, the needs of the new country
are great. They would not invite me to lecture so frequently,
if they had enough workers. To me, the opportunity
to help means obligation to help."</p>

<p>"Our Mother Esther has just returned from a conference
at Washington, and another in Montana," said
Kenneth, "and here she is going off again. The truth is
she has become an educational and moral force in the
Southwest."</p>

<p>"We are glad to share her with all who need her,"
said Carla, simply.</p>

<p>"Yes, lad," added Kenneth, rising, "we are glad she
has the power to help."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning, they were awakened early by John
Harding, calling Wathemah to let him in. Such a meeting
as that was! Jack did not seem to know how to behave.
The little unkempt lad, untutored, and undisciplined,
whom he had known and loved, was gone; and in
his place, stood a lithe, graceful, really elegant young
man. Jack stood back abashed. <i>His</i> Wathemah, his
little Wathemah, was gone. Something got in his throat.
He turned aside, and brushed his hand across his cheek.
But Wathemah slipped his arm around his neck, and
together they tramped off up the mountain for a visit.
Then Jack knew that his boy had really come back to
him, but developed and disciplined into a man of character
and force.</p>

<p>That was a gala day for Jack Harding and the Hastings
household. No one had ever seen Jack so happy
before.</p>

<p>Late that afternoon all stood on the veranda.</p>

<p>"My little kid," said Jack, laying his hand on Wathemah's
shoulder, "I've worked fur ye, prayed fur ye, all
the years. And now you've come, now you've come,"
he kept saying, over and over.</p>

<p>"Say, Jack," said Wathemah, "do you remember the
time you found me asleep up the canyon, and took up a
collection to send me East with Mother Esther?"</p>

<p>Jack nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, that money, with all that you have since sent
me, has been invested for you. And now, Jack, my dear
old pard, that money has made you a little fortune.
You need work no more."</p>

<p>Jack choked. He tried to speak, but turned his face
away. Esther slipped her arm through his, and told
him she wanted to visit with him. So the two walked
up and down the road in front of the house, talking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are all so happy over Wathemah," she said. "I
know you must be, too. He is really your boy, for you
saved him, Jack."</p>

<p>Then Jack Harding poured his heart out to her. She
understood him, all his struggles, all his great unselfish
love for the boy. She knew the pain of his awakening,
when he found that the child whom he had loved, whom
he had toiled for all these years, needed him no more.
It was pathetic to her.</p>

<p>"But, Jack dear," she was saying, "I am sure Wathemah
will always be a joy to you. Only wait. My heart
tells me he has some great purpose. He will tell us in
time. When he does, you will want to help him carry
out his plans, won't you?"</p>

<p>Up and down the veranda, walked Kenneth and Wathemah.
Kenneth's hand and arm rested on the youth's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Yes, Wathemah," he was saying, "little David's
death was a great sorrow to us. He was shot by an unfriendly
Indian, you know."</p>

<p>For a moment his face darkened. The two walked on
in silence.</p>

<p>"And Mother Esther?" Wathemah said in a husky
tone; "how can she still give her life for the uplift of
my people?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know as well as I. She serves a great
Master."</p>

<p>They talked from heart to heart, as father and son.</p>

<p>At last all the household gathered on the veranda to
watch the afterglow in the sky. Esther slipped her arm
through Wathemah's, and they stood facing the west.</p>

<p>"And so my boy is to enter the Indian service," she
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
"Yes," he answered. "You know I majored in anthropology
and education. My summers among various
Indian tribes were to help me know the Indian. My
thesis for my doctorate is to be on 'The Education of the
Indian in the United States.' When I have my material
ready, I'll return to Harvard and remain until I complete
my work for my doctorate."</p>

<p>"What next, Wathemah?" There was a thrill in
Esther's voice.</p>

<p>The Indian youth squared his shoulders, lifted his
head, and said, as though making a solemn covenant:</p>

<p>"The uplift of my race!"</p>

<p>And Esther's face was shining.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
